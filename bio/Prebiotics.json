They were first identified and named by Marcel Roberfroid\nin 1995. As a functional food component, prebiotics, like probiotics,\nare conceptually intermediate between foods and drugs. Depending on the\njurisdiction, they typically receive an intermediate level of regulatory\nscrutiny, in particular of the health claims made concerning them.\n\nRoberfroid offered a refined definition in the 2007 Journal of\nNutrition stating:  A prebiotic is a selectively\nfermented ingredient that allows specific changes, both in the composition\nand/or activity in the gastrointestinal microflora that confers benefits upon\nhost well-being and health\"\n\nAdditionally, in his 2007 revisit of Prebiotics, Roberfroid stated that only two\nparticular prebiotics then fully met this definition: trans-\ngalactooligosaccharide and inulin. Other\nauthorities also classify fructooligosaccharide (FOS) and lactulose as\nprebiotics. Mannan Oligosaccharides (MOS) have been termed as prebiotics but\nwould more correctly be termed immunosaccharides\n\nResearchers now also focus on the distinction between short-chain, long-chain,\nand full-spectrum prebiotics. \"Short-chain\" prebiotics, e.g. oligofructose,\ncontain 2-8 links per saccharide molecule and are typically fermented more\nquickly in the right-side of the colon providing nourishment to the bacteria in\nthat area. Longer-chain prebiotics, e.g. inulin, contain 9-64 links per\nsaccharide molecule, and tend to be fermented more slowly, nourishing bacteria\npredominantly in the left-side colon. Full-spectrum prebiotics provide the full\nrange of molecular link-lengths from 2-64 links per molecule, and nourish\nbacteria throughout the colon, e.g. Oligofructose-Enriched Inulin (OEI). The\nmajority of research done on prebiotics is based on full-spectrum prebiotics,\ntypically using OEI as the research\nsubstance.\n","linknr":298,"url":"Prebiotics","recorded":1362505797,"links":31,"instances":["mos"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Bacteriology","Digestive system","Prebiotics"],"headings":["Function","Sources","Effects","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mannan_oligosaccharide_based_nutritional_supplements","mos"],["mannan_oligosaccharide_based_nutritional_supplements","mos"]],"members":["mannan_oligosaccharide_based_nutritional_supplements"],"related":["Functional_food","Probiotics","Health_claims_on_food_labels","Galactooligosaccharide","Inulin","Fructooligosaccharide","Lactulose","Mannan_Oligosaccharide_based_nutritional_supplements_(MOS)","Ascending_colon","Descending_colon","Bifidobacteria","Lactic_acid_bacteria","Bifidus_factor","Soybeans","Inulin","Jerusalem_artichoke","Jicama","Chicory","Oat","Barley","Yacon","Breast_milk","Immune_system","Chicory_root","Jerusalem_artichoke","Chicory","Jerusalem_Artichoke","Dandelion","Leek","Asparagus","Wheat_bran","Wheat_flour","Fructooligosaccharide","Xylooligosaccharide","Polydextrose","Galactooligosaccharides","Lactulose","Tagatose","Mannooligosaccharide","Hypertension","Clostridium","Bacteroides","Western_diet","Prebiotic_scores","Probiotic","Mannan_Oligosaccharide_based_nutritional_supplements_(MOS)"]}
