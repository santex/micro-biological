{"cursor":"4089","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'functional symptom' is a medical symptom in an individual which is very\nbroadly conceived as arising from a problem in nervous system 'functioning' and\nnot due to a structural or pathologically defined disease cause. Functional\nsymptoms are increasingly viewed within a framework in which psychological,\nphysiological and biological factors should be considered to be relevant.\n\nHistorically, there has often been fierce debate about whether certain problems\nare predominantly related to an abnormality of structure (disease) or function\n(abnormal nervous system functioning), and what are at one stage posited to be\nfunctional symptoms are sometimes later reclassified as organic, as\ninvestigative techniques improve. Thus, on finding itself unable to discover\neffective treatments or physiological causes for symptoms, the medical\nprofession, in explaining to itself these limitations of its own power over\nnature, is of course subject to a temptation to minimize the explanatory role\nplayed by the many gaps in its own current scientific understanding, and instead\nto grope for theories of psychosomatic aetiology to account for the physical\nsymptoms that it cannot otherwise explain, and cannot cure. (To caricature this\nreasoning: \"I can't cure you: you must be mad\".) It is well established that\npsychosomatic symptoms are a real phenomenon, so this potential explanation is\noften plausible, not always easily refutable, and can be reassuring (at least\nfor the doctor). Sometimes it is correct. For example symptoms associated with\nmigraine, epilepsy, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, stomach ulcers, chronic\nfatigue syndrome, Lyme disease and many other conditions have all tended\nhistorically at first to be explained largely as physical manifestations of the\nsufferer's psychological state of mind; until such time as new physiological\nknowledge is eventually gained. At this point, a part of the earlier reliance on\npsychological explanations often evaporates. Taking a long, historical view,\ndoctors being human, there seems little reason to suppose that this historical\npattern of eventual correction of earlier psychological misattribution of\nsymptoms is yet become a thing of the past. Another specific example is\nfunctional constipation, which may have psychological or psychiatric causes.\nHowever, one type of apparently functional constipation, anismus, may have a\nneurological (physical) basis.\n\nWhilst misdiagnosis of functional symptoms does occur, in neurology, for\nexample, this appears to occur no more frequently than of other neurological\nor psychiatric syndromes. Although, in order to be quantified, misdiagnosis\nhas to be recognized as such, which can be problematic in such a challenging\nfield as medicine.\n\nA common trend is to see functional symptoms and syndromes such as fibromyalgia,\nirritable bowel syndrome and functional neurological symptoms such as functional\nweakness as symptoms in which both biological and psychological factors are\nrelevant, without one necessarily being dominant.\n","linknr":104,"url":"Functional_symptom","recorded":1376421891,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Functional_symptom&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Functional_symptom&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_symptom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Medicine","/wiki/Symptom","#cite_note-pmid12153926-1","/wiki/Migraine","/wiki/Epilepsy","/wiki/Schizophrenia","/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis","/wiki/Stomach_ulcers","/wiki/Chronic_fatigue_syndrome","/wiki/Lyme_disease","/wiki/Functional_constipation","/wiki/Anismus","/wiki/Fibromyalgia","/wiki/Irritable_bowel_syndrome","/wiki/Functional_weakness","/w/index.php?title=Functional_symptom&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Functional_symptom&veaction=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-pmid12153926_1-0","http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12153926","/wiki/BMJ","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1136%2Fbmj.325.7358.265","/wiki/PubMed_Central","//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1123778","/wiki/PubMed_Identifier","//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12153926","/w/index.php?title=Functional_symptom&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Functional_symptom&veaction=edit&section=2","http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1123778","http://content.apa.org/journals/pst/44/3/354","http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/325/7359/323","http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2005.02314.x?cookieSet=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Functional_symptom&oldid=561658064","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Medical_terminology","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Functional+symptom&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Functional+symptom","/wiki/Functional_symptom","/wiki/Talk:Functional_symptom","#","/wiki/Functional_symptom","/w/index.php?title=Functional_symptom&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Functional_symptom&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Functional_symptom&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Functional_symptom","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Functional_symptom","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Functional_symptom&oldid=561658064","/w/index.php?title=Functional_symptom&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5508852","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Functional_symptom&id=561658064","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Functional+symptom","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Functional+symptom&oldid=561658064&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Functional_symptom&printable=yes","//sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funktionella_symtom","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5508852#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_symptom","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=
