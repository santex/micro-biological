{"cursor":"4461","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'clandestine operation' is an intelligence or military operation carried out\nin such a way that the operation goes unnoticed by the general population.\n\nThe United States Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated\nTerms (Joint Publication JP1-02, dated 5 January 2007) defines \"clandestine\noperation\" as \"An operation sponsored or conducted by governmental departments\nor agencies in such a way as to assure secrecy or concealment. A clandestine\noperation differs from a covert operation in that emphasis is placed on\nconcealment of the operation rather than on concealment of the identity of the\nsponsor. In special operations, an activity may be both covert and clandestine\nand may focus equally on operational considerations and intelligence-related\nactivities.\" (JP 3-05.1).\n\nThe bulk of clandestine operations are related to the gathering of intelligence,\ntypically by both people (Clandestine HUMINT) and by hidden sensors. Placement\nof underwater or land-based communications cable taps, cameras, microphones,\ntraffic sensors, monitors such as sniffers, and similar systems require that the\nmission go undetected and unsuspected. Clandestine sensors may also be on\nunmanned underwater vehicles, reconnaissance (spy) satellites (such as Misty),\nlow-observability unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), or unmanned detectors (as in\nOperation Igloo White and its successors), or hand-placed by clandestine human\noperations.\n\nThe terms clandestine and covert are not synonymous. As noted in the definition\n(which has been used by the United States and NATO since World War II) in a\ncovert operation the identity of the sponsor is concealed, while in a\nclandestine operation the operation itself is concealed. Put differently,\nclandestine means \"hidden\", while covert means \"deniable\". The term stealth\nrefers both to a broad set of tactics aimed at providing and preserving the\nelement of surprise and reducing enemy resistance. It can also be used to\ndescribe a set of technologies (stealth technology) to aid in those tactics.\nWhile secrecy and stealthiness are often desired in clandestine and covert\noperations, the terms secret and stealthy are not used to formally describe\ntypes of missions.\n\nSome operations may have both clandestine and covert aspects, such as the use of\nconcealed remote sensors or human observers to direct artillery attacks and\nairstrikes. The attack is obviously covert (coming under attack alerts the\ntarget that he has been located by the enemy), but the targeting component (the\nexact method that was used to locate targets) can remain clandestine.\n\nIn World War II, targets found through cryptanalysis of radio communication,\nwere attacked only if there had been aerial reconnaissance in the area, or, in\nthe case of the shootdown of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, where the sighting could\nbe attributed to the Coastwatchers. During the Vietnam War, trucks attacked on\nthe Ho Chi Minh trail were completely unaware of some sensors, such as the\nairborne Black Crow device that sensed their ignition. They could also have been\nspotted by a clandestine human patrol. Harassing and interdiction (H&I) or free-\nfire zone rules can also cause a target to be hit for purely random reasons.\n\nUntil the 1970s, clandestine operations were primarily political in nature,\ngenerally aimed at assisting groups or nations favored by the sponsor. Examples\ninclude U.S. intelligence involvement with German and Japanese war criminals\nafter World War II. Today these operations are numerous and include technology-\nrelated clandestine operations.\n","linknr":131,"url":"Clandestine_operation","recorded":1376417382,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Clandestine_operation&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Clandestine_operation&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clandestine_operation","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Clandestine_operation&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Intelligence","/wiki/Military","/wiki/Military_operation","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Department_of_Defense_Dictionary_of_Military_and_Associated_Terms","/wiki/Government","/wiki/Government_agency","/wiki/Covert_operation","/wiki/List_of_intelligence_gathering_disciplines","/wiki/Clandestine_HUMINT","/wiki/Sensor","/wiki/Telephone_tapping","/wiki/Camera","/wiki/Microphone","/wiki/Sniffer","/wiki/Unmanned_underwater_vehicle","/wiki/Spy_satellite","/wiki/Misty_(classified_project)","/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle","/wiki/Measurement_and_Signature_Intelligence","/wiki/Operation_Igloo_White","/wiki/Measurement_and_Signature_Intelligence","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/NATO","/wiki/World_War_II","/wiki/Military_tactics","/wiki/Technology","/wiki/Stealth_technology","/wiki/Artillery","/wiki/Airstrike","/wiki/World_War_II","/wiki/Cryptanalysis","/wiki/Radio","/wiki/Naval_ranks_of_the_Japanese_Empire_during_World_War_II","/wiki/Isoroku_Yamamoto","/wiki/Coastwatchers","/wiki/Vietnam_War","/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_trail","/wiki/Radiofrequency_MASINT","/wiki/Free-fire_zone","/wiki/U.S._intelligence_involvement_with_German_and_Japanese_war_criminals_after_World_War_II","/w/index.php?title=Clandestine_operation&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Clandestine_operation&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/Black_operation","/wiki/Covert_operation","/wiki/Fifth_column","/w/index.php?title=Clandestine_operation&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Clandestine_operation&veaction=edit&section=2","/wiki/International_Society_for_Intelligence_Research","http://www.isironline.org/","http://www.clandestineoperations.tk","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Clandestine_operation&oldid=566241482","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Intelligence_operations","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_May_2008","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Clandestine+operation&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Clandestine+operation","/wiki/Clandestine_operation","/wiki/Talk:Clandestine_operation","#","/wiki/Clandestine_operation","/w/index.php?title=Clandestine_operation&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Clandestine_operation&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Clandestine_operation&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Clandestine_operation","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Clandestine_operation","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Clandestine_operation&oldid=566241482","/w/index.php?title=Clandestine_operation&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3354903","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Clandestine_operation&id=566241482","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Clandestine+operation","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=ren
