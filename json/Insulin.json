{"cursor":"71360","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Insulin' is a peptide hormone, produced by beta cells of the pancreas, and is\ncentral to regulating carbohydrate and fat metabolism in the body. Insulin\ncauses cells in the liver, skeletal muscles, and fat tissue to absorb glucose\nfrom the blood. In the liver and skeletal muscles, glucose is stored as\nglycogen, and in fat cells (adipocytes) it is stored as triglycerides.\n\nInsulin stops the use of fat as an energy source by inhibiting the release of\nglucagon. With the exception of the metabolic disorder diabetes mellitus and\nmetabolic syndrome, insulin is provided within the body in a constant proportion\nto remove excess glucose from the blood, which otherwise would be toxic. When\nblood glucose levels fall below a certain level, the body begins to use stored\nsugar as an energy source through glycogenolysis, which breaks down the glycogen\nstored in the liver and muscles into glucose, which can then be utilized as an\nenergy source. As a central metabolic control mechanism, its status is also used\nas a control signal to other body systems (such as amino acid uptake by body\ncells). In addition, it has several other anabolic effects throughout the body.\n\nWhen control of insulin levels fails, diabetes mellitus can result. As a\nconsequence, insulin is used medically to treat some forms of diabetes mellitus.\nPatients with type 1 diabetes depend on external insulin (most commonly injected\nsubcutaneously) for their survival because the hormone is no longer produced\ninternally. Patients with\ntype 2 diabetes are often insulin resistant and, because of such resistance, may\nsuffer from a \"relative\" insulin deficiency. Some patients with type 2 diabetes\nmay eventually require insulin if other medications fail to control blood\nglucose levels adequately. Over 40% of those with Type 2 diabetes require\ninsulin as part of their diabetes management plan.\n\nThe human insulin protein is composed of 51 amino acids, and has a molecular\nweight of 5808 Da. It is a dimer of an A-chain and a B-chain, which are linked\ntogether by disulfide bonds.\n\nInsulin's name is derived from the Latin insula for \"island\". Insulin's\nstructure varies slightly between species of animals. Insulin from animal\nsources differs somewhat in \"strength\" (in carbohydrate metabolism control\neffects) in humans because of those variations. Porcine insulin is especially\nclose to the human version.\n","linknr":1615,"url":"Insulin","recorded":1376414400,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Insulin&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Insulin&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Inulin","/wiki/File:InsulinHexamer.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/InsulinHexamer.jpg/250px-InsulinHexamer.jpg","/wiki/Symmetry","/wiki/Zinc","/wiki/Histidine","#cite_note-pmid9235985-1","/wiki/Protein_Data_Bank","http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/searchResults.html?display=both&term=P01308%20or%20P30410%20or%20P01326%20or%20Q5EEX1%20or%20P01323%20or%20P67970%20or%20O73727%20or%20A5PF52","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/search/smartSubquery.do?smartSearchSubtype=UpAccessionIdQuery&accessionIdList=P01308,P30410,P01326,Q5EEX1,P01323,P67970,O73727,A5PF52","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1A7F","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1AI0","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1AIY","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1B9E","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1BEN","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1EFE","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1EV3","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1EV6","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1EVR","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1FU2","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1FUB","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1G7A","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1G7B","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1GUJ","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1HIQ","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1HIS","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1HIT","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1HLS","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1HTV","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1HUI","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1IOG","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1IOH","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1J73","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1JCA","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1JCO","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1K3M","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1KMF","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1LKQ","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1LPH","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1MHI","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1MHJ","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1MSO","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1OS3","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1OS4","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1Q4V","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1QIY","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1QIZ","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1QJ0","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1RWE","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1SF1","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1SJT","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1SJU","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1T0C","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1T1K","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1T1P","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1T1Q","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1TRZ","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1TYL","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1TYM","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1UZ9","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1VKT","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1W8P","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1XDA","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1XGL","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1XW7","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1ZEG","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1ZEH","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1ZNJ","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=2AIY","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=2C8Q","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=2C8R","http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=
