{"cursor":"20013","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\n{{Infobox Disease\n | Name = Adverse effect Image = Caption = DiseasesDB = ICD10 = ICD9 = ICDO =\n | OMIM = MedlinePlus = eMedicineSubj = eMedicineTopic = MeshID =\n}} In medicine, an 'adverse effect' is a harmful and undesired effect resulting\nfrom a medication or other intervention such as surgery.\n\nAn adverse effect may be termed a \"side effect\", when judged to be secondary to\na main or therapeutic effect. If it results from an unsuitable or incorrect\ndosage or procedure, this is called a medical error and not a complication.\nAdverse effects are sometimes referred to as \"iatrogenic\" because they are\ngenerated by a physician/treatment. Some adverse effects only occur only when\nstarting, increasing or discontinuing a treatment.\n\nUsing a drug or other medical intervention which is contraindicated may increase\nthe risk of adverse effects. Adverse effects may cause complications of a\ndisease or procedure and negatively affect its prognosis. They may also lead to\nnon-compliance with a treatment regimen.\n\nThe harmful outcome is usually indicated by some result such as morbidity,\nmortality, alteration in body weight, levels of enzymes, loss of function, or as\na pathological change detected at the microscopic, macroscopic or physiological\nlevel. It may also be indicated by symptoms reported by a patient. Adverse\neffects may cause a reversible or irreversible change, including an increase or\ndecrease in the susceptibility of the individual to other chemicals, foods, or\nprocedures, such as drug interactions.\n\nIn clinical trials, a distinction is made between adverse events (AEs) and\nserious adverse events (SAEs). Generally, any event which causes death,\npermanent damage, birth defects, or requires hospitalization is considered an\nSAE.

the\nmedication to provide information both for patients and the prescribing\nphysicians.\n","linknr":523,"url":"Adverse_effect_(medicine)","recorded":1362510345,"links":42,"instances":["medicine","mood","pharmacology","medicine","anatomy","medical","biology","element","menopause","medical","biochemistry","united_states"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Medical
