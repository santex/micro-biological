{"cursor":"3818","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Conditions races' are horse races where the weights carried by the runners are\nlaid down by the conditions attached to the race. Weights are allocated\naccording to; the sex of the runners, with female runners carrying less weight\nthan males; the age of the runners, with younger horses receiving weight from\nolder runners to allow for relative maturity, referred to as weight for age; and\nquality of runners, with horses that have won certain values of races giving\nweight to less successful entrants.\n\nConditions races are distinct from handicap races, where the weights carried are\nlaid down by an official handicapper to equalise the difference in ability\nbetween the runners.\n\nConditions races are staged at all levels of horse racing, as all of the most\nimportant races in Europe are conditions races, the term may also refer to the\nraces for the very best horses, which are split into four levels, namely:\n*European Pattern Races **Group 1 (G1) â (Classics and other races of major\ninternational importance) **Group 2 (G2) â (less important international races)\n**Group 3 (G3) â (primarily domestic races) *Listed Races â have less prestige\nthan the group races but are still more important than handicaps.\n\nThe pattern system, overseen by the European Pattern Committee, is fluid and the\nGroup status of key races can change. By this method, the Prince of Wales Stakes\nat Royal Ascot was upgraded from Group 2 to Group 1 in the year 2000. However, a\nnumber of checks and balances are in place which ensure that changes to the\nPattern are gradual and evolutionary, thereby giving the racing industry time to\nadjust. In particular, the current European Pattern Committee \"Ground Rules\"\nexplicitly state that no race may be upgraded by more than one Group in any one\nyear. Such restrictions can prove troublesome when major new races are launched.\nFor example, the Dubai World Cup, the world's richest horse race, was only given\nListed status for its inaugural running in 1996.\n\nThe pattern system exerts a huge influence on the bloodstock market,\nparticularly in relation to the stud fee that a stallion can command for\ncovering a mare at stud. This will be dictated almost entirely by the stallion's\nperformances in Pattern races during its racing career. Only the very best\nhorses can perform successfully in Group 1 events and such animals invariably\ncommand the highest stud fees when their racing career is at an end. A top-\nquality stallion can be enormously lucrative for its owners â stud fees of more\nthan US$100,000 are relatively commonplace for the most coveted stallions.\n\nIn North America, the best horses race in \"graded stakes races\" instead of\n\"conditions races\". The division is similar to that for pattern races in the\nrest of the world:\n* Grade I\n* Grade II\n* Grade III\n\nIn Australia and New Zealand, the best horses race in \"Group races\" which are\ndecided by the Australian Racing Board and New Zealand Thoroughbred Racing\nIncorporated respectively. These races are divided into four levels:\n\n* Group 1\n* Group 2\n* Group 3\n* Listed races\n\nUnlike in some other countries, handicap races can be included in the North\nAmerican and Australian grading system; although most graded stakes race in\nNorth America and Group races in Australia are most conditions races, and\nhandicaps are more often seen in races of lower level, there are still several\nhandicaps that are Grade I or Group 1 races respectively.\n\n'For lists of races go to:'\n\n*List of British flat horse races *List of French flat horse races *List of\nIrish flat horse races
