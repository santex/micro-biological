The division had been formed (at the direction of Winston Churchill,\nthe First Lord of the Admiralty) at the outbreak of war as the 'Royal Naval\nDivision'. The division was composed largely of surplus reserves of the Royal\nNavy who were not required at sea, formed around a cadre of\nRoyal Marines.\n\nThe division participated in the defence of the Belgian city of Antwerp in late\n1914. From Antwerp, 1,500 sailors of the division fled to the neutral\nNetherlands, where they were interned. The division was shipped to\nEgypt prior to serving in the Battle of Gallipoli where it fought on both the\nAnzac and Helles battlefields. By the end of the Dardanelles campaign,\ncasualties were such that the division no longer contained a significant number\nof naval servicemen and so in July 1916 it was redesignated as the 63rd\nDivision when the original Territorial Force 63rd (2nd\nNorthumbrian) Division was disbanded. The division moved to the Western Front in\nFrance for the remainder of the war.\n","linknr":452,"url":"Royal_Naval_Division","recorded":1376416416,"links":["/w/index.php?title=63rd_(Royal_Naval)_Division&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=63rd_(Royal_Naval)_Division&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/63rd_(Royal_Naval)_Division","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Royal_Naval_Division&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/World_War_I","/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland","/wiki/New_Army_(British)","/wiki/Infantry","/wiki/Antwerp_(city)","/wiki/Battle_of_Gallipoli","/wiki/Battle_of_the_Somme_(1916)","/wiki/Third_Battle_of_Ypres","/wiki/63rd_(2nd_Northumbrian)_Division","/wiki/World_War_I","/wiki/Division_(military)","/wiki/Kitchener%27s_Army","/wiki/Winston_Churchill","/wiki/First_Lord_of_the_Admiralty","/wiki/Royal_Navy","#cite_note-TNA-1","/wiki/Royal_Marines","/wiki/Belgium","/wiki/Antwerp_(city)","/wiki/Neutrality_(international_relations)","/wiki/Netherlands","/wiki/Intern","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Egypt","/wiki/Battle_of_Gallipoli","/wiki/Anzac_Cove","/wiki/Cape_Helles","/wiki/Dardanelles","#cite_note-TNA-1","/wiki/Territorial_Force","/wiki/63rd_(2nd_Northumbrian)_Division","/wiki/Western_Front_(World_War_I)","/wiki/France","#cite_note-TNA-1","#Unit_history","#France_and_Antwerp_1914","#Gallipoli","#Western_Front","#Ancre","#Ypres","#Order_of_battle","#Battles","#See_also","#References","#Sources_and_further_reading","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=63rd_(Royal_Naval)_Division&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=63rd_(Royal_Naval)_Division&veaction=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=63rd_(Royal_Naval)_Division&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=63rd_(Royal_Naval)_Division&veaction=edit&section=2","/wiki/Lee-Enfield#Short_Magazine_Lee-Enfield_Mk_I","/w/index.php?title=63rd_(Royal_Naval)_Division&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=63rd_(Royal_Naval)_Division&veaction=edit&section=3","/wiki/29th_Division_(United_Kingdom)","/wiki/Battle_of_Gallipoli","/wiki/Anzac_Cove","/wiki/Cape_Helles","/wiki/Bernard_Freyberg","/wiki/Australia","/wiki/New_Zealand","/w/index.php?title=63rd_(Royal_Naval)_Division&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=63rd_(Royal_Naval)_Division&veaction=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=63rd_(Royal_Naval)_Division&action=edit&section=5","/w/index.php?title=63rd_(Royal_Naval)_Division&veaction=edit&section=5","/wiki/Battle_of_the_Somme_(1916)","/wiki/Battle_of_Ancre","#cite_note-FOOTNOTEThompson2001148-3","#cite_note-Thompson-4","/wiki/Rolling_barrage","#cite_note-Thompson-4","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Bernard_Freyberg","#cite_note-Hart-6","#cite_note-Thompson-4","#cite_note-Hart-6","/wiki/Major_General","/wiki/Archibald_Paris_(Royal_Marines_officer)","/wiki/Cameron_Shute","/wiki/A._P._Herbert","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","#cite_note-7","/w/index.php?title=63rd_(Royal_Naval)_Division&action=edit&section=6","/w/index.php?title=63rd_(Royal_Naval)_Division&veaction=edit&section=6","/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Passchendaele","#cite_note-Thompson2-8","/w/index.php?title=63rd_(Royal_Naval)_Division&action=edit&section=7","/w/index.php?title=63rd_(Royal_Naval)_Division&veaction=edit&section=7","/wiki/File:Royal_Naval_Division_recruiting_poster.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Royal_Naval_Division_recruiting_poster.jpg/220px-Royal_Naval_Division_recruiting_poster.jpg","/wiki/File:Royal_Naval_Division_recruiting_poster.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/File:CathaysCemy_CWGSection_RNVR_HAle_8244.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/CathaysCemy_CWGSection_RNVR_HAle_8244.jpg/220px-CathaysCemy_CWGSection_RNVR_HAle_8244.jpg","/wiki/File:CathaysCemy_CWGSection_RNVR_HAle_8244.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Cathays_Cemetery","/wiki/Able_seaman","/wiki/George_Anson,_1st_Baron_Anson","/wiki/John_Benbow","/wiki/Cuthbert_Collingwood,_1st_Baron_Collingwood","/wiki/Francis_Drake","/wiki/Edward_Hawke","/wiki/Samuel_Hood,_1st_Viscount_Hood","/wiki/Richard_Howe,_1st_Earl_Howe","/wiki/Horati
