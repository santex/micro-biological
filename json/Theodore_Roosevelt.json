He is noted for his exuberant personality,\nrange of interests and achievements, and his leadership of the Progressive\nMovement, as well as his \"cowboy\" persona and robust masculinity. [http://www.americanheritage.com/content/theodore-roosevelts-\nwild-side Douglas Brinkley] \"TR's Wild Side,\" American Heritage, Fall\n2009. He was a leader of the Republican Party and founder of the\nfirst incarnation of the short-lived Progressive (\"Bull Moose\") Party of\n1912. Before becoming President, he held offices at the city, state, and\nfederal levels. Roosevelt's achievements as a naturalist, explorer, hunter,\nauthor, and soldier are as much a part of his fame as any office he held as\na politician. Roosevelt was 42 years old when sworn in as President of the\nUnited States in 1901, making him the youngest president ever; he beat out\nthe youngest elected president, John Fitzgerald \"Jack\" Kennedy, by only one\nyear. While John F. Kennedy is the youngest person to be elected as\nPresident, Roosevelt was not officially elected to the Presidency until\n1904, when he was 46. Roosevelt was also the first of only three\nsitting presidents to have won the Nobel Peace Prize. The other two\npresidents who won the Nobel Peace Prize while in office were Woodrow\nWilson (1919) and Barack Obama (2009). The Teddy bear is named for\nhim, despite his contempt for being called \"Teddy\".\n[http://www.theodoreroosevelt.org/life/trrancher.htm Home - Theodore\nRoosevelt Association]. Theodoreroosevelt.org (2013-02-01). Retrieved on\n2013-07-15.\n\nBorn into a wealthy family in New York City, Roosevelt was a sickly child who\nsuffered from asthma and stayed at home studying natural history. To overcome\nhis physical weakness, he embraced a strenuous life. Home-schooled, he became an\neager student of nature. He attended Harvard University, where he studied\nbiology, boxed and developed an interest in naval affairs. In 1881, one year out\nof Harvard, he was elected to the New York State Assembly, where he became a\nleader of the reform faction of his Republican Party (the \"GOP\"). His The Naval\nWar of 1812 (1882) established his professional reputation as a serious\nhistorian; he wrote numerous books on hunting, the outdoors, and current\npolitical issues, as well as frontier history. In 1884, his first wife and his\nmother died on the same day. He temporarily left politics and went to the\nfrontier, becoming a rancher in the \"Badlands\" in the Dakotas. Returning to New\nYork City, he ran for mayor in 1886, finishing third with 60,000 votes. He later\ngained fame by taking vigorous charge of the city police. At the national level,\nhe was a leader in civil service reform. The SpanishâAmerican War broke out in\n1898 while Roosevelt was, effectively, running the Department of the Navy. He\npromptly resigned and formed the Rough Riders â a volunteer cavalry\nregiment that fought in Cuba. The war hero was elected governor in 1898 and in\n1900 was nominated for vice president. He successfully energized the GOP base as\na highly visible campaigner to reelect President William McKinley, Jr. on a\nplatform of high tariffs, the gold standard, imperialism, prosperity at home and\nvictory abroad.\n\nIn 1901, President McKinley was assassinated and Roosevelt became President. He\nattempted to move the Republican Party (GOP) toward Progressivism, including\ntrust busting and increased regulation of businesses. Roosevelt became the first\nperson elected to a term in his own right in 1904 after having ascended to the\nPresidency (from the Vice-Presidency) upon the death of his\npredecessor, winning the largest percentage of the popular vote since\nthe uncontested election of 1820. Roosevelt coined the phrase \"Square Deal\" to\ndescribe his domestic agenda, emphasizing that the average citizen would get a\nfair share under his policies. As an outdoorsman and naturalist, he promoted the\nconservation movement. On the world stage, Roosevelt's policies were\ncharacterized by his slogan, \"Speak softly and carry a big stick\". Roosevelt was\nthe force behind the completion of the Panama Canal; sent the Great White Fleet\non a world tour to demonstrate American power; and negotiated an end to the Russo-\nJapanese War, for which he won the Nobel Peace Prize. Frederick W. Marks\nIII, Velvet on Iron: The Diplomacy of Theodore Roosevelt (1979); Greg Russell,\n\"Theodore Roosevelt's Diplomacy and the Quest for Great Power Equilibrium in\nAsia,\" Presidential Studies Quarterly 2008 38(3): 433â455\n\nAt the end of his second term, Roosevelt promoted his friend William Howard Taft\nfor the 1908 Republican nomination. He toured Africa and Europe. On his return\nin 1910 he broke bitterly with President Taft on issues of progressivism and\npersonalities. In the 1912 election Roosevelt tried and failed to block Taft's\nrenomination. He launched the Bull Moose Party that called for far-reaching\nprogressive reforms. He lost to Democrat Woodrow Wilson, as the Taft\nconservatives gained control of the Republican party for decades to come.\nRoosevelt led a major expedition to the Amazon jungles but contracted diseases\nwhich ruined his health. Roosevelt has consistently been ranked by scholars as\none of the greatest U.S. Presidents, having revived a declining\npresidency.\n","linknr":2714,"url":"Theodore_Roosevelt","recorded":1376415013,"links":["//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt_(disambiguation)","/wiki/Wikipedia:Protection_policy#semi","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg/20px-Padlock-silver.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Protection_policy#semi","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg/20px-Padlock-silver.svg.png","/wiki/File:T_Roosevelt.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/T_Roosevelt.jpg/220px-T_Roosevelt.jpg","/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States","/wiki/President_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Charles_W._Fairbanks","/wiki/William_McKinley","/wiki/William_Howard_Taft","/wiki/List_of_Vice_Presidents_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States","/wiki/William_McKinley","/wiki/Garret_Hobart","/wiki/Charles_W._Fairbanks","/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_New_York","/wiki/Governor_of_New_York","/wiki/Timothy_L._Woodruff","/wiki/Frank_S._Black","/wiki/Benjamin_Barker_Odell,_Jr.","/wiki/Assistant_Secretary_of_the_Navy","/wiki/William_McKinley","/wiki/William_McAdoo_(New_Jersey)","/wiki/Charles_Herbert_Allen","/wiki/New_York_City,_New_York","/wiki/United_States_of_America","/wiki/Oyster_Bay_(hamlet),_New_York","/wiki/United_States_of_America","/wiki/Youngs_Memorial_Cemetery","/wiki/Oyster_Bay_(hamlet),_New_York","/wiki/History_of_the_Republican_Party_(United_States)","/wiki/Progressive_Party_(United_States,_1912)","/wiki/Alice_Hathaway_Lee_Roosevelt","/wiki/Edith_Roosevelt","/wiki/Alice_Roosevelt_Longworth","/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt,_Jr.","/wiki/Kermit_Roosevelt","/wiki/Ethel_Roosevelt_Derby","/wiki/Archibald_Roosevelt","/wiki/Quentin_Roosevelt","/wiki/Alma_mater","/wiki/Harvard_College","/wiki/Columbia_Law_School","/wiki/Reformed_Church_in_America","/wiki/Freethought","#cite_note-1","/wiki/File:Theodore_Roosevelt_Signature-2.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Theodore_Roosevelt_Signature-2.svg/128px-Theodore_Roosevelt_Signature-2.svg.png","/wiki/United_States_Army","/wiki/File:US-O6_insignia.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/US-O6_insignia.svg/15px-US-O6_insignia.svg.png","/wiki/Colonel_(United_States)","/wiki/Rough_Riders","/wiki/Spanish%E2%80%93American_War","/wiki/Battle_of_Las_Guasimas","/wiki/Battle_of_San_Juan_Hill","/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize","/wiki/Medal_of_Honor","/wiki/File:Theodore_Roosevelt_bookplate.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Theodore_Roosevelt_bookplate.jpg/200px-Theodore_Roosevelt_bookplate.jpg","#cite_note-ahs-2","#cite_note-ahs-2","#cite_note-Presidential_Ham-3","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English","/wiki/Wikipedia:Pronunciation_respelling_key","#cite_note-4","/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States","/wiki/President_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Progressive_Era","/wiki/Cowboy","/wiki/Masculinity","#cite_note-test-5","/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_Republican_Party","/wiki/Progressive_Party_(United_States,_1912)","/wiki/John_F._Kennedy","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Teddy_bear","#cite_note-8","/wiki/Asthma","/wiki/Natural_history","/wiki/Harvard_University","/wiki/New_York_State_Assembly","/wiki/History_of_the_Republican_Party_(United_States)","/wiki/Alice_Hathaway_Lee_Roosevelt","/wiki/Martha_Bulloch_Roosevelt","/wiki/Spanish%E2%80%93American_War","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Navy","/wiki/Rough_Riders","/wiki/Cuba","/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_New_York","/wiki/William_McKinley","/wiki/Assassination_of_William_McKinley","/wiki/Progressive_Era","/wiki/Trust_busting","/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1904","#cite_note-9
