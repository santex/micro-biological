Its history, quality of\neducation, academic influence, and wealth have made it one of the most\nprestigious universities in the\nworld.\n\nHarvard was established in 1636 by the Massachusetts legislature, being the\noldest institution of higher learning and the first corporation\n(officially The President and Fellows of Harvard College) chartered in the\ncountry. It was named after its first benefactor, John Harvard. Although never\nformally affiliated with a church, the college primarily trained\nCongregationalist and Unitarian clergy. Harvard's curriculum and students became\nsecular throughout the 18th century and by the 19th century had emerged as the\ncentral cultural establishment among Boston elites.\nFollowing the American Civil War, President Charles W. Eliot's forty-year tenure\n(1869â1909) transformed the college and affiliated professional schools into a\ncentralized research university, and Harvard became a founding member of the\nAssociation of American Universities in 1900. James Bryant\nConant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II and\nbegan to reform the curriculum and liberalize admissions after the war. The\nundergraduate college became coeducational after its 1977 merger with Radcliffe\nCollege. Drew Gilpin Faust was elected the 28th president in 2007 and is the\nfirst woman to lead the university.\n\nThe university comprises eleven separate\nacademic unitsâten faculties and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Studyâwith\ncampuses throughout the Boston metropolitan area. Harvard's main\ncampus is centered on Harvard Yard in Cambridge, approximately northwest of\ndowntown Boston. The business school and athletics facilities, including Harvard\nStadium, are located across the Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of\nBoston and the medical, dental, and public health schools are located in the\nLongwood Medical Area. The Harvard University Library\nis the largest academic library in the United States, and one of the largest in\nthe world.\n\nEight U.S. presidents have been graduates, and 144 Nobel Laureates have been\nstudent, faculty, or staff affiliates. Harvard is also the alma mater of sixty-\ntwo living billionaires, the most in the country.\n\nThe Harvard Crimson competes in 42 intercollegiate sports in the NCAA Division I\nIvy League. Harvard has an intense athletic rivalry with Yale University\nculminating in [[HarvardâYale football rivalry|The Game]], although the\nHarvardâYale Regatta predates the football game. This rivalry, though, is put\naside every two years when the Harvard and Yale Track and Field teams come\ntogether to compete against a combined Oxford University and Cambridge\nUniversity team, a competition that is the oldest continuous international\namateur competition in the world.\n\nHarvard has the largest financial endowment of any academic institution in the\nworld, standing at $30.4 billion as of September 2012.\n","linknr":1787,"url":"Harvard","recorded":1376420235,"links":["//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Harvard&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Harvard_(disambiguation)","/wiki/Wikipedia:Protection_policy#semi","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg/20px-Padlock-silver.svg.png","/wiki/File:Harvard_Wreath_Logo_1.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3a/Harvard_Wreath_Logo_1.svg/220px-Harvard_Wreath_Logo_1.svg.png","/wiki/Seal_(emblem)","/wiki/Latin_language","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-founding-2","/wiki/Private_university","/wiki/Financial_endowment","/wiki/1000000000_(number)","#cite_note-NACUBO-3","/wiki/University_president","/wiki/Drew_Gilpin_Faust","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Undergraduate_education","/wiki/Postgraduate_education","/wiki/Cambridge,_Massachusetts","/wiki/Urban_area","#cite_note-Campus-5","/wiki/The_Harvard_Crimson","/wiki/School_colors","/wiki/Crimson","/wiki/Ivy_League","/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association","/wiki/Division_I_(NCAA)","/wiki/Athletic_nickname","/wiki/Harvard_Crimson","http://www.harvard.edu/","/wiki/File:Harvard_University_logo.PNG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/91/Harvard_University_logo.PNG","/wiki/Private_university","/wiki/Ivy_League","/wiki/Doctoral_university","/wiki/Cambridge,_Massachusetts","/wiki/Massachusetts","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-9","/wiki/Massachusetts_General_Court","/wiki/Colonial_Colleges","#cite_note-10","/wiki/Corporation","/wiki/John_Harvard_(clergyman)","/wiki/Congregational_church","/wiki/Unitarianism","/wiki/Boston_Brahmin","#cite_note-11","#cite_note-12","/wiki/American_Civil_War","/wiki/Charles_W._Eliot","/wiki/Research_university","/wiki/Association_of_American_Universities","#cite_note-AAU-13","/wiki/James_Bryant_Conant","/wiki/Great_Depression","/wiki/World_War_II","/wiki/Radcliffe_College","/wiki/Drew_Gilpin_Faust","/wiki/Radcliffe_Institute_for_Advanced_Study","#cite_note-14","/wiki/Harvard_Yard","/wiki/Boston","/wiki/Harvard_Business_School","/wiki/Harvard_Stadium","/wiki/Charles_River","/wiki/Allston","/wiki/Harvard_Medical_School","/wiki/Harvard_School_of_Dental_Medicine","/wiki/Harvard_School_of_Public_Health","/wiki/Longwood_Medical_and_Academic_Area","#cite_note-Campus-5","/wiki/Harvard_University_Library","#cite_note-largestlibs-15","/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States_by_education","/wiki/List_of_Nobel_laureates_by_university_affiliation","/wiki/Alma_mater","/wiki/Billionaires","#cite_note-16","/wiki/Harvard_Crimson","/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association","/wiki/Division_I_(NCAA)","/wiki/Ivy_League","/wiki/Yale_University","/wiki/Harvard%E2%80%93Yale_football_rivalry","/wiki/Harvard%E2%80%93Yale_Regatta","/wiki/Track_and_Field","/wiki/Oxford_University","/wiki/Cambridge_University","#cite_note-17","/wiki/List_of_colleges_and_universities_in_the_United_States_by_endowment","/wiki/Financial_endowment","#cite_note-NACUBO-3","#History","#Colonial","#19th_century","#Religion_and_philosophy","#20th_century","#Meritocracy","#Women","#Liberalism","#Recent_history","#Campus","#Satellite_facilities","#Major_campus_expansion","#Sustainability","#Endowment","#Academics","#Teaching_and_learning","#Academic_organization","#Research","#Libraries_and_museums","#University_rankings","#Tradition_and_culture","#Athletics","#Song","#People","#Students","#Faculty_and_staff","#Notable_alumni","#Literature_and_popular_culture","#In_literature","#Onscreen","#See_also","#References","#Further_reading","#External_links","/wiki/History_of_Harvard_University","/wiki/File:A_Westerly_View_of_the_Colledges_in_Cambridge_New_England_by_Paul_Revere.jpeg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/A_Westerly_View_of_the_Colledges_in_Cambridge_New_England_by_Paul_Revere.jpeg/220px-A_Westerly_View_of_the_Colledges_in_Cambridge_New_England_by_Paul_Revere.jpeg","/wiki/File:A_Westerly_View_of_the_Colledges_in_Cambridge_New_England_by_Paul_Revere.jpeg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/co
