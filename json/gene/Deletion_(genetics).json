Deletion is the loss of\ngenetic material. Any number of nucleotides can be deleted, from a single base\nto an entire piece of chromosome. Lewis R. 2005. Human\nGenetics: Concepts and Applications, 6th Ed. McGraw Hill, New York.\nDeletions can be caused by errors in chromosomal crossover during meiosis. This\ncauses several serious genetic diseases. Deletion also causes frameshift.\n","linknr":309,"url":"Deletion_(genetics)","recorded":1362374160,"links":39,"instances":["letter","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Genetics"],"headings":["Causes","Types","Effects","Detection","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Deletion.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["delta","letter"],["translation","genetics"]],"members":["delta","translation"],"related":["Genetics","Delta_(letter)","Mutation","Chromosome","DNA","Nucleotide","Chromosomal_crossover","Meiosis","Genetic_disease","Frameshift","Chromosomal_translocation","Chromosomal_crossover","Chromosomal_inversion","Unequal_crossing_over","Synapsis","Williams_syndrome","Frameshift_mutation","Codon","Translation_(genetics)","Protein","Infertility","Duchenne_muscular_dystrophy","Cri_du_chat","Survival_motor_neuron","Spinal_muscular_atrophy","HCONDELs","Indel","Chromosome_abnormalities","Null_allele","List_of_genetic_disorders","Medical_genetics"]}
