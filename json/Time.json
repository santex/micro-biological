One view\nis that time is part of the fundamental structure of the universe â a dimension\nindependent of events, in which events occur in sequence.

This second view, in the tradition of Gottfried Leibniz {{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/leib-met/#H7\n|title=Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646â1716) Metaphysics â 7.

In short, an empty space would be a substance with no properties; it will\nbe a substance that even God cannot modify or destroy.... That is, space and\ntime are internal or intrinsic features of the complete concepts of things, not\nextrinsic.... Leibniz's view has two major implications. First, there is no\nabsolute location in either space or time; location is always the situation of\nan object or event relative to other objects and events. Second, space and time\nare not in themselves real (that is, not substances). Space and time are,\nrather, ideal. Space and time are just metaphysically illegitimate ways of\nperceiving certain virtual relations between substances. They are phenomena or,\nstrictly speaking, illusions (although they are illusions that are well-founded\nupon the internal properties of substances).... It is sometimes convenient to\nthink of space and time as something \"out there,\" over and above the entities\nand their relations to each other, but this convenience must not be confused\nwith reality. Space is nothing but the order of co-existent objects; time\nnothing but the order of successive events.

Another way to\nput the point is to say that the fact that the mind of the knower makes the a\npriori contribution does not mean that space and time or the categories are mere\nfigments of the imagination. Kant is an empirical realist about the world we\nexperience; we can know objects as they appear to us. He gives a robust defense\nof science and the study of the natural world from his argument about the mind's\nrole in making nature. All discursive, rational beings must conceive of the\nphysical world as spatially and temporally unified, he argues. |accessdate=2011-04-\n09}}  holds that time is neither an event nor a thing, and thus is not\nitself measurable nor can it be travelled.\n\nTime is one of the seven fundamental physical quantities in the International\nSystem of Units. Time is used to define other quantities â such as velocity â so\ndefining time in terms of such quantities would result in circularity of\ndefinition. Duff, Okun, Veneziano, ibid. p. 3. \"There is\nno well established terminology for the fundamental constants of Nature. ... The\nabsence of accurately defined terms or the uses (i.e., actually misuses) of ill-\ndefined terms lead to confusion and proliferation of wrong statements.\" \nAn operational definition of time, wherein one says that observing a certain\nnumber of repetitions of one or another standard cyclical event (such as the\npassage of a free-swinging pendulum) constitutes one standard unit such as the\nsecond, is highly useful in the conduct of both advanced experiments and\neveryday affairs of life. The operational definition leaves aside the question\nwhether there is something called time, apart from the counting activity just\nmentioned, that flows and that can be measured. Investigations of a single\ncontinuum called spacetime bring questions about space into questions about\ntime, questions that have their roots in the works of early students of natural\nphilosophy.\n\nFurthermore, it may be that there is a subjective component to time, but whether\nor not time itself is \"felt\", as a sensation or an experience, has never been\nsettled.\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* \n*\n*\n* {{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/?id=HrHvAAAAMAAJ&q=%22time+is+what+-\n  clocks+measure%22&dq=%22time+is+what+clocks+measure%22 | title=Physics\n| first1=Donald G. | last1=Ivey | first2=J.N.P. |last2=Hume volume=1 | page=65 |\n| year=1974 publisher=Ronald Press quote=Our operational definition of time is\n| that time is what clocks measure.}}\n {{cite encyclopedia |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2004/entries/time-\nexperience |title=The Experience and Perception of Time |last=Le Poidevin\n|first=Robin |year=Winter 2004 |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of\nPhilosophy |editor=Edward N.
