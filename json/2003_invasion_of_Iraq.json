The invasion consisted of 21 days of major combat operations, in\nwhich a combined force of troops from the United States, the United Kingdom,\nAustralia, and Poland, invaded Iraq and deposed the Ba'athist government of\nSaddam Hussein. The invasion phase consisted primarily of a conventionally-\nfought war which concluded with the capture of the Iraqi capital of Baghdad by\nAmerican forces.\n\nFour countries participated with troops during the initial invasion phase, which\nlasted from 19 March to 9 April 2003. These were the United States (148,000),\nUnited Kingdom (45,000), Australia (2,000), and Poland (194). 36 other countries\nwere involved in its aftermath. In preparation for the invasion, 100,000 U.S.\ntroops were assembled in Kuwait by 18 February. The United States\nsupplied the majority of the invading forces, but also received support from\nKurdish irregulars in Iraqi Kurdistan.\n\nAccording to U.S. President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony\nBlair, the coalition mission was \"to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction,\nto end Saddam Hussein's support for terrorism, and to free the Iraqi\npeople.\" Former chief counter-terrorism adviser on the\nNational Security Council Richard A. Clarke believes Bush took office with a\npredetermined plan to invade Iraq. Andrew Buncombe, \"Richard Clarke: 'Iraq\ncould be much more of a problem for America than if Saddam had stayed in power',\nThe Monday Interview: Former White House security chief\", The Independent,\nWashington, 14 June 2004. General Wesley Clark, the former Supreme NATO\nAllied Commander and Joint Chiefs of Staff Director of Strategy and Policy,\ndescribes in his 2003 book, Winning Modern Wars, his conversation with a\nmilitary officer in the Pentagon shortly after 9/11 regarding a plan to attack\nseven Middle Eastern countries in five years: \"As I went back through the\nPentagon in November 2001, one of the senior military staff officers had time\nfor a chat. Yes, we were still on track for going against Iraq, he said. But\nthere was more. This was being discussed as part of a five-year campaign plan,\nhe said, and there were a total of seven countries, beginning with Iraq, then\nSyria, Lebanon, Libya, Iran, Somalia and Sudan.\" Wesley Clark, Winning\nModern Wars (New York: Public Affairs, 2003), 130 Others place a much\ngreater emphasis on the impact of the 11 September 2001 attacks, and the role\nthis played in changing U.S. strategic calculations, and the rise of the freedom\nagenda.

In 2005, the Central Intelligence Agency released a report\nsaying that no weapons of mass destruction had been found in Iraq.\n\nIn a January 2003 CBS poll 64% of Americans had approved of military action\nagainst Iraq, however 63% wanted Bush to find a diplomatic solution rather than\ngo to war, and 62% believed the threat of terrorism directed against the U.S.\nwould increase due to war.

The invasion of Iraq was strongly opposed by some long-\nstanding U.S. allies, including the governments of France, Germany, New Zealand,\nand Canada. Exception was Denmark, where even the popular opinion supported\nthe invasion and Denmark as a member of the coalition.

On 15 February 2003, a month before the\ninvasion, there were worldwide protests against the Iraq War, including a rally\nof three million people in Rome, which is listed in the Guinness Book of Records\nas the largest ever anti-war rally. {{cite web\n| url =\n| http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=54365\n| title = Guinness World Records, Largest Anti-War Rally| accessdate =11 January\n| 2007| publisher = Guinness World Records| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org-\n| /web/20040904214302/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/content_pages/record.-\n| asp?recordid=54365| archivedate = 4 September 2004}} According to the\n| French academic Dominique ReyniÃ©, between 3 January and 12 April 2003, 36\n| million people across the globe took part in almost 3,000 protests against the\n| Iraq war. {{cite news| first = Alex|\n| last = Callinicos| title = Anti-war protests do make a difference| url =\n| http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/article.php?article_id=6067| publisher =\n| Socialist Worker date = 19 March 2005| accessdate =11 January 2007}}\n\nThe invasion was preceded by an air strike on the Presidential Palace in\nBaghdad on 19 March 2003. The following day coalition forces launched an\nincursion into Basra Province from their massing point close to the Iraqi-\nKuwaiti border. While the special forces launched an amphibious assault from\nthe Persian Gulf to secure Basra and the surrounding petroleum fields, the main\ninvasion army moved into southern Iraq, occupying the region and engaging in\nthe Battle of Nasiriyah on 23 March. Massive air strikes across the country and\nagainst Iraqi command and control threw the defending army into chaos and\nprevented an effective resistance. On 26 March the 173rd Airborne Brigade was\nairdropped near the northern city of Kirkuk where they joined forces with\nKurdish rebels and fought several actions against the Iraqi army to secure the\nnorthern part of the country.\n\nThe main body of coalition forces continued their drive into the heart of Iraq\nand met with little resistance. Most of the Iraqi military was quickly defeated\nand Baghdad was occupied on 9 April. Other operations occurred against pockets\nof the Iraqi army including the capture and occupation of Kirkuk on 10 April,\nand the attack and capture of Tikrit on 15 April. Iraqi President Saddam\nHussein and the central leadership went into hiding as the coalition forces\ncompleted the occupation of the country. On 1 May an end of major combat\noperations was declared, ending the invasion period and beginning the military\noccupation period.\n\nAs of December 2011, the 2003 invasion of Iraq was the most recent armed\nconflict between standing national armies causing at least 1,000
