The name of the precursor for a protein is often\nprefixed by pro. Examples include proinsulin and proopiomelanocortin.\n\nProtein precursors are often used by an organism when the subsequent protein is\npotentially harmful, but needs to be available on short notice and/or in large\nquantities. Enzyme precursors are called zymogens or proenzymes. Examples are\nenzymes of the digestive tract in humans.\n\nSome protein precursors are secreted from the cell. Many of these are\nsynthesized with an N-terminal signal peptide that targets them for secretion.\nLike other proteins that contain a signal peptide, their name is prefixed by\npre. They are thus called 'pre-pro-proteins' or 'pre-pro-peptides'. The signal peptide is cleaved off in the endoplasmic\nreticulum. An example is preproinsulin.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Protein_precursor","recorded":1376427640,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Proteins"],"headings":["References"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Protein","Peptide","Posttranslational_modification","Proinsulin","Proopiomelanocortin","Enzyme","Zymogen","Proenzyme","Signal_peptide","Endoplasmic_reticulum","Preproinsulin"]}
