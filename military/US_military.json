They consist of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Coast\nGuard. The U.S. has a strong tradition of civilian control of the\nmilitary. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and\nhelps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal\nexecutive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is\ncarried out. The DoD is headed by the Secretary of Defense, who is a civilian\nand Cabinet member. The Defense Secretary is second in the military's chain of\ncommand, just below the President, and serves as the principal assistant to the\nPresident in all DoD-related matters. Title 10 of the United States Code [http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-\ncgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t09t12+45+1++%28%29%20%20AND%20%28%2810%29%20ADJ-\n%20USC%29%3ACITE%20AND%20%28USC%20w%2F10%20%28113%29%29%3ACITE%20%20%20%20%20%2-\n0%20%20%20 Â§113] To coordinate military action with diplomacy, the\nPresident has an advisory National Security Council headed by a National\nSecurity Advisor. Both the President and Secretary of Defense are advised by a\nseven-member Joint Chiefs of Staff, which includes the head of each of the\nDefense Department's service branches as well as the chief of the National Guard\nBureau. Leadership is provided by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and\nthe Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The\nCommandant of the Coast Guard is not a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nAll of the branches work together during operations and joint missions, under\nthe Unified Combatant Commands, under the authority of the Secretary of Defense\nwith the exception of the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard falls under the\nadministration of the Department of Homeland Security and receives its\noperational orders from the Secretary of Homeland Security. The Coast Guard may\nbe transferred to the Department of the Navy by the President or Congress during\na time of war. The United States Coast Guard has both military and law\nenforcement functions. Title 14 of the United States Code provides that \"The\nCoast Guard as established 28 January 1915, shall be a military service and a\nbranch of the armed forces of the United States at all times.\" Coast Guard\nunits, or ships of its predecessor service, the Revenue Cutter Service, have\nseen combat in every war and armed conflict of the United States since 1790,\nincluding the Iraq War. All five armed services are among the seven\nuniformed services of the United States; the others are the U.S. Public Health\nService Commissioned Corps and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration Commissioned Corps.\n\nFrom the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the\nhistory of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged\nas a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even\nso, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force and not until the\noutbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially\nestablished. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II\nand during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the\nAct merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the\nNavy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense\nin 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the\nAir Force and National Security Council.\n\nThe U.S. military is one of the largest militaries in terms of number of\npersonnel. It draws its manpower from a large pool of paid volunteers; although\nconscription has been used in the past in various times of both war and peace,\nit has not been used since 1972. As of 2013, the U.S. spends about $554.2\nbillion annually to fund its military forces, and appropriates approximately\n$88.5 billion to fund Overseas Contingency Operations. Put together, the U.S. constitutes roughly 43 percent of the world's\nmilitary expenditures. The U.S. Armed Forces as a whole possess large quantities\nof advanced and powerful equipment, along with widespread placement of forces\naround the world, giving them significant capabilities in both defense and power\nprojection.\n","linknr":1944,"url":"US_military","recorded":1376416153,"links":["/w/index.php?title=United_States_Armed_Forces&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=United_States_Armed_Forces&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=US_military&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Jointcolors.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Jointcolors.jpg/300px-Jointcolors.jpg","/wiki/Fort_Myer","/wiki/United_States_Army","/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps","/wiki/United_States_Navy","/wiki/United_States_Air_Force","/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard","/wiki/The_Pentagon","/wiki/Arlington_County,_Virginia","/wiki/Virginia","/wiki/President_of_the_United_States","/wiki/President_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Barack_Obama","/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense","/wiki/Chuck_Hagel","/wiki/Chairman_of_the_Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff","/wiki/General_(United_States)","/wiki/Martin_Dempsey","/wiki/United_States_Army","#cite_note-goarmy.com-1","#cite_note-CIA_World_Factbook-USA-2","#cite_note-Armed_Forces_Strength-3","/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_military_and_paramilitary_personnel","#cite_note-Reserve_Forces-4","/wiki/National_Defense_Authorization_Act_for_Fiscal_Year_2013","#cite_note-Reserve_Forces-4","#cite_note-5","/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures","/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War","/wiki/Military_history_of_the_United_States#Early_national_period_.281783.E2.80.931815.29","/wiki/Military_history_of_the_United_States#Continental_expansion_.281816.E2.80.931860.29","/wiki/American_Civil_War","/wiki/Military_history_of_the_United_States#Post-Civil_War_era_.281865.E2.80.931917.29","/wiki/World_War_I","/wiki/World_War_II","/wiki/Cold_War","/wiki/Korean_War","/wiki/Vietnam_War","/wiki/Persian_Gulf_War","/wiki/Kosovo_War","/wiki/War_on_Terror","/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001%E2%80%93present)","/wiki/Iraq_War","/wiki/List_of_wars_involving_the_United_States","/wiki/United_States_Army_officer_rank_insignia","/wiki/Warrant_Officer_(United_States)","/wiki/United_States_Army_enlisted_rank_insignia","/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps_officer_rank_insignia","/wiki/Warrant_Officer_(United_States)","/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps_enlisted_rank_insignia","/wiki/United_States_Navy_officer_rank_insignia","/wiki/Warrant_Officer_(United_States)","/wiki/United_States_Navy_enlisted_rates","/wiki/United_States_Air_Force_officer_rank_insignia","/wiki/United_States_Air_Force_enlisted_rank_insignia","/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard_officer_rank_insignia","/wiki/Warrant_Officer_(United_States)","/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard_enlisted_rate_insignia","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Armed_forces","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/United_States_Army","/wiki/United_States_Navy","/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps","/wiki/United_States_Air_Force","/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Civilian_control_of_the_military","/wiki/President_of_the_United_States","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense","/wiki/United_States_federal_executive_departments","/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense","/wiki/United_States_Cabinet","/wiki/Chain_of_command","#cite_note-8","/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council","/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)","/wiki/Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff","/wiki/National_Guard_Bureau","/wiki/Chairman_of_the_Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff","/wiki/Vice_Chairman_of_the_Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff","#cite_note-JCS01-9","/wiki/Commandant_of_the_Coast_Guard","/wiki/Unified_Combatant_Command","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security","/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Homeland_Security","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Navy","#cite_note-10","/wiki/Uniformed_services_of_the_United_States","/wiki/United_States_Public_Health_Service_Commissioned_Corps","/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration_Commissioned_Corps","/wiki/History_of_the_United_States","/wiki/First_Barbary_War","/wiki/Second_Barbary_War","/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States","/wiki/World_War_II","/wiki/National_Security_Act_of_1947","/
