Penn archivist Mark Frazier Lloyd\n[http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/current/node/2231] notes: âIn 1899, Pennâs\nTrustees adopted a resolution that established 1740 as the founding date, but\ngood cases may be made for 1749, when Franklin first convened the Trustees, or\n1751, when the first classes were taught at the affiliated secondary school for\nboys, Academy of Philadelphia, or 1755, when Penn obtained its collegiate\ncharter to add a post-secondary institution, the College of Philadelphia.\"\nPrinceton's library [http://www.princeton.edu/mudd/news/faq/topics/older.shtml]\npresents another, diplomatically phrased view. |type=Private\n|affiliations=Ivy League, AAU, COFHE |endowment=$6.755 billion (2012) As of\nJune 30, 2012.  |budget=$6.007 billion\n|president=Amy Gutmann |provost=Vincent Price |academic_staff=4,246 faculty\nmembers |administrative_staff=2,347 |students=21,329\n|undergrad=10,301 |postgrad=11,028 |city=Philadelphia |state=Pennsylvania |country=United States\n|campus=Urban, total: , University City campus; , New Bolton Center; , Morris\nArboretum |colors = Red Blue |athletics =NCAA\nDivision I |nickname=Quakers |alma mater=Hail, Pennsylvania! |website= |logo=}}\nThe 'University of Pennsylvania' (commonly referred to as 'Penn' or 'UPenn') is\nan American private Ivy League research university located in Philadelphia,\nPennsylvania, United States. It is one of the Colonial Colleges. Incorporated as\nThe Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania, Penn is one of 14 founding\nmembers of the Association of American Universities.\n\nBenjamin Franklin, Penn's founder, advocated an educational program that focused\nas much on practical education for commerce and public service as on the\nclassics and theology. Penn was one of the first academic institutions to follow\na multidisciplinary model pioneered by several European universities,\nconcentrating multiple \"faculties\" (e.g., theology, classics, medicine) into one\ninstitution. It was also home to many other educational innovations.\nThe first school of medicine in North America (Perelman School of Medicine,\n1765), the first collegiate business school (Wharton, 1881) and the first\nstudent union (Houston Hall, 1896), were\nall born at Penn.\n\nPenn offers a broad range of academic departments, an extensive research\nenterprise and a number of community outreach and public service programs. It is\nparticularly well known for its medical school, design school, dental school,\nschool of business, law school, communications school, nursing school,\nveterinary school, its social sciences and humanities programs, as well as its\nbiomedical teaching and research capabilities. Its undergraduate programs are\nalso among the most selective in the country (12.1% acceptance rate). One of Penn's most well known\nacademic qualities is its emphasis on interdisciplinary education, which it\npromotes through numerous joint degree programs, research centers and\nprofessorships, a unified campus, and the ability for students to take classes\nfrom any of Penn's schools (the \"One University Policy\").\n\nAll of Penn's schools, alone or jointly, exhibit very high research activity.\nPenn is consistently included among the top five research universities in the\nUnited States, and among the top research universities in the world,\nfor both quality and quantity of research. In fiscal year 2011, Penn\ntopped the Ivy League in academic research spending with an $814 million\nbudget, involving some 4,000 faculty, 1,100 postdoctoral fellows and 5,400\nsupport staff/graduate assistants. As one of the\nmost active and prolific research institutions, Penn is associated with several\nimportant innovations and discoveries in many fields of science and the\nhumanities. Among them are the first general purpose electronic computer\n(ENIAC), the Rubella and Hepatitis B vaccines, Retin-A, cognitive therapy,\nconjoint analysis and others.\n\nPenn's academic and research programs are led by a large and highly productive\nfaculty. In the last ten years alone 9 Penn\nfaculty members or graduates have won a Nobel Prize. Over its long history the\nuniversity has also produced many distinguished alumni. These include 12 heads\nof state (including one U.S. President), 3 United States Supreme Court justices,\nand supreme court justices of other states, founders of technology companies,\ninternational law firms, and global financial institutions, university\npresidents and 18 living billionaires.\n","linknr":1925,"url":"University_of_Pennsylvania","recorded":1376416074,"links":["/w/index.php?title=University_of_Pennsylvania&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=University_of_Pennsylvania&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_University","/wiki/File:UPenn_shield_with_banner.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/UPenn_shield_with_banner.svg/200px-UPenn_shield_with_banner.svg.png","/wiki/Latin_language","/wiki/Latin","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Private_university","/wiki/Financial_endowment","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-Penn:_Penn_Facts-3","/wiki/University_president","/wiki/Amy_Gutmann","/wiki/Provost_(education)","/wiki/Vincent_Price_(educator)","#cite_note-Penn:_Penn_Facts-3","#cite_note-Penn:_Penn_Facts-3","#cite_note-Penn:_Penn_Facts-3","/wiki/Undergraduate_education","#cite_note-Penn:_Penn_Facts-3","/wiki/Postgraduate_education","#cite_note-Penn:_Penn_Facts-3","/wiki/Philadelphia","/wiki/University_City,_Philadelphia,_Pennsylvania","/wiki/New_Bolton_Center","/wiki/Morris_Arboretum","/wiki/School_colors","#cite_note-Style_Guide.2C_Logos_.26_Branding-4","#cite_note-Color_Palette_.26_Typography-5","/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association","/wiki/Division_I_(NCAA)","/wiki/Athletic_nickname","/wiki/Penn_Quakers","/wiki/Ivy_League","/wiki/Association_of_American_Universities","/wiki/Consortium_on_Financing_Higher_Education","http://www.upenn.edu/","/wiki/File:UPenn_logo.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6a/UPenn_logo.svg/200px-UPenn_logo.svg.png","/wiki/Private_university","/wiki/Ivy_League","/wiki/Doctoral_university","/wiki/Philadelphia","/wiki/Colonial_Colleges","/wiki/Association_of_American_Universities","/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin","/wiki/Entrepreneur","/wiki/Public_services","/wiki/Multidisciplinary","/wiki/Theology","/wiki/Classics","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Innovations","/wiki/Perelman_School_of_Medicine_at_the_University_of_Pennsylvania","/wiki/Wharton_School_of_the_University_of_Pennsylvania","/wiki/Student_activity_center","/wiki/Houston_Hall_(University_of_Pennsylvania)","#cite_note-University_Archives-7","/wiki/Community_outreach","/wiki/Perelman_School_of_Medicine_at_the_University_of_Pennsylvania","/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania_School_of_Design","/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania_School_of_Dental_Medicine","/wiki/Wharton_School_of_the_University_of_Pennsylvania","/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania_Law_School","/wiki/Annenberg_School_for_Communication_at_the_University_of_Pennsylvania","/wiki/Social_sciences","/wiki/Humanities","/wiki/Biomedical","#cite_note-Daily_Pennsylvanian_Admission_rate-8","/wiki/Joint_degree","/wiki/Professorships","#cite_note-9","#cite_note-10","#cite_note-11","/wiki/Fiscal_year","/wiki/Budget","#cite_note-Penn:_Penn_Facts-3","/wiki/ENIAC","/wiki/Rubella","/wiki/Hepatitis_B","/wiki/Retin-A","/wiki/Cognitive_therapy","/wiki/Conjoint_analysis","#cite_note-chronicle.com-12","/wiki/Nobel_Prize","/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court","#cite_note-Billionaire_Universities-13","#History","#Educational_innovations","#Motto","#Seal","#Campus","#Libraries","#The_University_Museum","#Residences","#Academics","#Coordinated_dual-degree_and_interdisciplinary_programs","#Academic_medical_center_and_biomedical_research_complex","#Admissions_selectivity","#Research.2C_innovations.2C_and_discoveries","#Rankings","#Student_life","#Demographics","#Selected_student_organizations","#The_Daily_Pennsylvanian","#Athletics","#Rowing","#Rugby","#Football","#Basketball","#Facilities","#Notable_people","#Controversies","#See_also","#Notes","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=University_of_Pennsylvania&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=University_of_Pennsylvania&veaction=edit&section=1","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Unbalanced_scales.svg/45px-Unbalanced_scales.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view","/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV_dispute","/wiki/Talk:University_of_Pennsylvania#.23","/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOVD#What_is_an_NPOV_dis
