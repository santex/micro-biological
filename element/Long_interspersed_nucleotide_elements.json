{"cursor":"15112","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Retrotransposons' (also called transposons via RNA intermediates) are genetic\nelements that can amplify themselves in a genome and are ubiquitous components\nof the DNA of many eukaryotic organisms. They are a subclass of transposon. They\nare particularly abundant in plants, where they are often a principal component\nof nuclear DNA. In maize, 49-78% of the genome is made up of\nretrotransposons. In wheat, about 90% of\nthe genome consists of repeated sequences and 68% of transposable elements. In mammals, almost half the genome (45% to 48%) comprises\ntransposons or remnants of transposons. Around 42% of the human genome is made\nup of retrotransposons, while DNA transposons account for about 2-3%.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Long_interspersed_nucleotide_elements","recorded":1376429008,"links":[],"instances":["genetics","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Mobile genetic elements","Molecular biology"],"headings":["Biological activity","Types of retrotransposons","See also","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["amplification","molecular_biology#gene_duplication_as_amplification"],["transposition","genetics"],["insertion","genetics"]],"members":["insertion","transposition","amplification"],"related":["Genetics","Genome","Eukaryote","Transposon","DNA","Maize","DNA_replication","Transposition_(genetics)","Genome","Transposable_elements","Mutation","Insertion_(genetics)","RNA","DNA","Reverse_transcriptase","Transposable_elements","Long_terminal_repeat","Non-LTR_retrotransposons","Direct_repeat","Pseudoviridae","Metaviridae","Haploid","Cell_nucleus","Algae","Bryophytes","Gymnosperms","Angiosperms","Open_reading_frame","RNA_polymerase_II","Reverse_transcriptase","Endonuclease","RNase_H","Untranslated_region","Poly-A","Transposons","Chromatin","RNA_polymerase_III","TRNA","5S_ribosomal_RNA","Alu_sequence","Restriction_enzyme","Bovine_genome","Transposon","Insertion_sequences","Copy-number_variation","Endogenous_retrovirus","Genomic_organization","Interspersed_repeat","Retrotransposon_marker","RetrOryza"]}
