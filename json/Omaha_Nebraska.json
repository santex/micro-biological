It is\nlocated in the Midwestern United States on the Missouri River, about\n10 miles (16 km) north of the mouth of the Platte River. Omaha is the\nanchor of the Omaha-Council Bluffs metropolitan area, which includes Council\nBluffs, Iowa, across the Missouri River from Omaha.\n\nAccording to the 2010 Census, Omaha's population was 408,958, making it the\nnation's 42nd-largest city. According to the 2012 Population Estimates, Omaha's\npopulation was 421,570. Including its suburbs, Omaha formed the 60th-largest\nmetropolitan area in the United States in 2010, with an estimated population of\n877,110 residing in eight counties. The Omaha-Council Bluffs-Fremont, NE-IA\nCombined Statistical Area is 922,051, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2012\nestimate. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Combined_Statistical_Areas There are more than 1.2 million residents within a 50-mile (80-km) radius\nof the city's center, forming the Greater Omaha area.\n\nOmaha's pioneer period began in 1854 when the city was founded by speculators\nfrom neighboring Council Bluffs, Iowa. The city was founded along the Missouri\nRiver, and a crossing called Lone Tree Ferry earned the city its nickname, the\n\"Gateway to the West.\" It introduced this new West to the world when in 1898 it\nplayed host to the World's Fair, dubbed the Trans-Mississippi Exposition. During\nthe 19th century, Omaha's central location in the United States spurred the city\nto become an important national transportation hub. Throughout the rest of the\n19th century, the transportation and jobbing sectors were important in the city,\nalong with its railroads and breweries. In the 20th century, the Omaha\nStockyards, once one the world's largest, and its meatpacking plants, gained\ninternational prominence.\n\nToday, Omaha is the home to the headquarters of five Fortune 500 companies: packaged-\nfood giant ConAgra Foods; the U.S.'s largest railroad operator, Union Pacific\nCorporation; insurance and financial firm Mutual of Omaha; one of the world's\nlargest construction companies, Kiewit Corporation; and mega-conglomerate\nBerkshire Hathaway.

Enron began in Omaha as Northern Natural Gas in 1930 before\ntaking over a smaller Houston company in 1985 to form InterNorth, which was\nmoved permanently to Houston in 1987 by the notorious Kenneth Lay.\n\nThe modern economy of Omaha is diverse and built on skilled knowledge jobs. In\n2009, [[Forbes]] identified Omaha as the nation's number one \"Best Bang-For-The\nBuck City\" and number one on \"America's Fastest-Recovering Cities\" list.\nTourism in Omaha benefits the city's economy greatly, with the annual College\nWorld Series providing important revenue and the city's Henry Doorly Zoo\nserving as the top attraction in Nebraska. Omaha hosted the Olympic swim trials\nin 2008 and in 2012.\n\nNotable modern Omaha inventions include the TV dinner, developed by Omaha's then-\nCarl Swanson Co.; Raisin Bran, developed by Omaha's Skinner Macaroni\nCo.; cake mix, developed by Duncan Hines, then a division of Omaha's Nebraska\nConsolidated Mills, the forerunner to today's ConAgra Foods; Butter Brickel Ice\nCream and the Reuben sandwich, conceived by a chef at the then-Blackstone Hotel\non 33rd and Farnam Streets; center-pivot irrigation by Omaha's now-\nValmont Corporation; the bobby pin and the \"pink hair curler,\" at\nOmaha's Tip Top; the ski lift, in 1936, by Omaha's Union Pacific\nCorp; the \"Top 40\" radio format, pioneered by Todd Storz, scion of\nOmaha's Storz Brewing Co., and head of Storz Broadcasting, which was the first\nin the U.S. to use the \"Top 40\" format at Omaha's KOWH Radio.

Much of the push toward preservation came\nafter Omaha gained the notorious designation of having, in 1989, demolished the\nlargest-ever National Register historic district in the United States, a record\nthat still stands as of 2013. The Jobbers Canyon Historic District, along the\nMissouri River, was felled for a new headquarters campus for ConAgra Foods, a\ncompany which threatened to relocate if Omaha did not allow them to raze the\ncity's historic district. The Jobber's Canyon warehouses had before then been\nallowed to deteriorate and were the scene of several fires set by the homeless\npopulation that had come to live in the abandoned buildings. At the time, there\nwere no plans in place for revitalizing the so-called landmark\nbuildings. Gratz, R.B.

John Wiley and Sons. p. 80.\n\nSince its founding, ethnic groups in the city have clustered in enclaves in\nnorth, south and downtown Omaha. In its early days, the sometimes lawless nature\nof a new frontier city included crime, such as illicit gambling and riots.\nToday, the diverse culture of Omaha includes a variety of performance venues,\nmuseums, and musical heritage, including the historically significant jazz scene\nin North Omaha and the modern and influential \"Omaha Sound\". Sports have been\nimportant in Omaha for more than a century, and the city currently plays host to\nthree minor-league professional sports teams. It is perhaps more known as the\nhome of the College World Series, to which it has played host since 1950. The\nKings, an NBA franchise, called Omaha and Kansas City home from 1972 to\n1978. The Kansas City-Omaha Kings split their time between the two\ncities, playing at Kansas City's Municipal Auditorium and the Omaha Civic\nAuditorium, before decamping solely to Kansas City until 1985, when the team\nmoved to its current home of
