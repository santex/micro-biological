Its\ncapital is Pyongyang, the country's largest city by both land area and\npopulation. The Amnok River and the Tumen River form the international border\nbetween North Korea and China. A small section of the Tumen River also lies\nalong the border between North Korea and Russia, technically following the\nriver's thalweg. The Korean Demilitarized Zone forms\nthe boundary between North Korea and South Korea. The legitimacy of this border\nis not accepted by either side, as both states claim to be the legitimate\ngovernment of the entire peninsula.\n\nThe Korean peninsula was governed by the Korean Empire from the late 19th\ncentury to the early 20th century, until it was annexed by the Empire of Japan\nin 1910. After the surrender of Japan at the end of World War II, Japanese rule\nceased. The Korean peninsula was divided into two occupied zones in 1945, with\nthe northern half of the peninsula occupied by the Soviet Union and the southern\nhalf by the United States. A United Nationsâsupervised election held in 1948 led\nto the creation of separate Korean governments for the two occupation zones: the\nDemocratic People's Republic of Korea in the north, and the Republic of Korea in\nthe south. The conflicting claims of sovereignty led to the Korean War in 1950.\nAn armistice in 1953 committed both to a cease-fire, but the two countries\nremain officially at war because a formal peace treaty was never\nsigned. Both states were accepted into the United Nations in\n1991.\n\nThe Workers' Party of Korea holds de facto power in the state and leads the\nDemocratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland of which all political\nofficers are required to be a member. The government\nfollows the [[Juche]] ideology of self-reliance, initiated by the country's\nfirst President, Kim Il-sung. Juche became the official state ideology,\nreplacing MarxismâLeninism, when the country adopted a new constitution in\n1972. {{Cite book\n| last=Martin first=Bradley K. authorlink= coauthors= title=Under the Loving\n| Care of the Fatherly Leader: North Korea and the Kim Dynasty publisher=Thomas\n| Dunne Books year=2004 location=New York City, New York page=111 quote=Although\n| it was in that 1955 speech that Kim gave full voice to his arguments for\n| juche, he had been talking along similar lines as early as 1948. doi= id= isbn=0-312-32322-\n| 0}} In 2009, references to Communism (ChosÅn'gÅ­l: ) were removed from\n| the country's constitution.
