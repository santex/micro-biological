It is an ancient university founded in 1495 when William\nElphinstone, Bishop of Aberdeen, petitioned Pope Alexander VI on behalf of James\nIV, King of Scots to create King's College. This\nmakes it Scotland's third-oldest university (after the University of St. Andrews\nand the University of Glasgow) and fifth-oldest in the English-speaking world.\nThe university as it is today was formed in 1860 by a merger between King's\nCollege (which had always referred to itself as the University of Aberdeen) and\nMarischal College, a second university founded in 1593 in Aberdeen city centre\nas a Protestant alternative to Kings College. Today, the University of Aberdeen\nis consistently ranked among the top 150 universities in the world and is one of\ntwo universities in Aberdeen today (the other is The Robert Gordon University).\n\nThe university's iconic buildings act as symbols of the City of Aberdeen,\nparticularly Marischal College in the city centre and the spire of King's\nCollege in Old Aberdeen. There are two campuses; the main King's College campus\nis at Old Aberdeen approximately two miles north of the city centre, around the\noriginal site of King's College, although most campus buildings were constructed\nin the 20th century during a period of expansion. The university's Foresterhill\ncampus is located next to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and houses the School of\nMedicine and Dentistry and School of Medical Sciences.\n\nThe University has approximately 13,500 students from undergraduate to doctoral\nlevel, including many international students. There are also large numbers of\nMasters and PhD students. In addition, the university's Centre for Lifelong\nLearning acts as an extension college, offering higher education courses to the\nlocal community even for those without the usual qualifications for admission to\ndegree-level study. A full range of disciplines are offered, including the\nliberal arts, science, social sciences, psychology, mathematics, engineering,\nlaw, medicine, education, computing science, music, divinity, theology and\nreligious studies. In 2012, the university offered over 650 undergraduate degree\nprogrammes.\n\nFive Nobel Prize winners are associated with the University. Other\nacademics and graduates of the University include many distinguished figures,\nincluding: physicist James Clerk Maxwell; Thomas Reid, the founder of the\nScottish School of Common Sense and an important figure in the Scottish\nEnlightenment; philosopher Robert Adamson; educationalist and philosopher\nAlexander Bain; and theologian William Robinson Clark.\n","linknr":931,"url":"University_of_Aberdeen","recorded":1376414581,"links":["/w/index.php?title=University_of_Aberdeen&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=University_of_Aberdeen&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Aberdeen","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=University_of_Aberdeen&params=57.165_N_-2.100_E_type:edu","/wiki/File:Coat_of_Arms_of_the_University_of_Aberdeen.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9f/Coat_of_Arms_of_the_University_of_Aberdeen.jpg/220px-Coat_of_Arms_of_the_University_of_Aberdeen.jpg","/wiki/Latin_language","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Public_university","/wiki/Financial_endowment","/wiki/Pound_sterling","#cite_note-endow-2","/wiki/Pound_sterling","#cite_note-endow-2","/wiki/Chancellor_(education)","/wiki/Camilla,_Duchess_of_Cornwall","/wiki/Rector_(academia)","/wiki/Principal_(university)","/wiki/Ian_Diamond","#cite_note-endow-2","/wiki/Undergraduate_education","#cite_note-endow-2","/wiki/Postgraduate_education","#cite_note-endow-2","/wiki/Aberdeen","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/School_colors","/wiki/Burgundy_(colour)","/wiki/White","/wiki/Association_of_Commonwealth_Universities","http://www.abdn.ac.uk/","/wiki/File:University_of_Aberdeen_logoHQ.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b2/University_of_Aberdeen_logoHQ.png/260px-University_of_Aberdeen_logoHQ.png","/wiki/Public_university","/wiki/Aberdeen","/wiki/Ancient_universities_of_Scotland","/wiki/King_James_IV","/wiki/King%27s_College,_Aberdeen","#cite_note-foundation-3","/wiki/University_of_St._Andrews","/wiki/University_of_Glasgow","/wiki/Marischal_College","/wiki/The_Robert_Gordon_University","/wiki/Aberdeen","/wiki/Marischal_College","/wiki/Aberdeen_Royal_Infirmary","/wiki/PhD","/wiki/Liberal_arts","/wiki/Science","/wiki/Social_sciences","/wiki/Psychology","/wiki/Mathematics","/wiki/Engineering","/wiki/Legal_education","/wiki/Medicine","/wiki/Teacher_education","/wiki/Computing_science","/wiki/Music","/wiki/Divinity_(academic_discipline)","/wiki/Theology","/wiki/Religious_studies","#cite_note-4","/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell","/wiki/Thomas_Reid","/wiki/Scottish_School_of_Common_Sense","/wiki/Scottish_Enlightenment","/wiki/Robert_Adamson_(philosopher)","/wiki/Alexander_Bain","/wiki/William_Robinson_Clark","#History","#King.27s_and_Marischal_Colleges","#The_University_of_Aberdeen.27s_creation","#The_modern_university","#Locations","#King.27s_College","#Marischal_College","#Others","#Foresterhill","#Hilton","#Organisation_and_administration","#Governance","#Chancellor","#Lord_Rector","#Principal_and_Vice-Chancellor","#Symbols_of_the_university","#Coat_of_arms","#Motto","#Tartan","#Academic_dress","#Colleges_and_faculties","#Academic_profile","#Rankings","#Student_life","#Student_representation","#Student_organisations","#University_accommodation","#Sports","#Music","#Student_media","#Notable_alumni","#Nobel_Prize_winners","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=University_of_Aberdeen&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=University_of_Aberdeen&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/Ancient_universities_of_Scotland","/wiki/King%27s_College,_Aberdeen","/wiki/Marischal_College","/w/index.php?title=University_of_Aberdeen&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=University_of_Aberdeen&veaction=edit&section=2","/wiki/File:Kings_College,_University_of_Aberdeen.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Kings_College%2C_University_of_Aberdeen.jpg/220px-Kings_College%2C_University_of_Aberdeen.jpg","/wiki/File:Kings_College,_University_of_Aberdeen.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/King%27s_College,_Aberdeen","/wiki/William_Elphinstone","/wiki/Bishop_of_Aberdeen","/wiki/Chancellor","/wiki/University_of_Glasgow","/wiki/James_IV_of_Scotland","/wiki/Pope_Alexander_VI","/wiki/Papal_Bull","#cite_note-foundation-3","/wiki/Hector_Boece","/wiki/University_of_Paris","/wiki/Scottish_Reformation","/wiki/George_Keith,_5th_Earl_Marischal","/wi
