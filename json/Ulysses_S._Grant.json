Grant' (born 'Hiram Ulysses Grant'; April\n  27, 1822 â July 23, 1885) was the 18th President of the United States\n  (1869â1877) following his highly successful role as a war general in the\n  second half of the Civil War. Under Grant, the Union Army defeated the\n  Confederate military; the war, and secession, ended with the surrender of\n  Robert E. Lee's army at Appomattox. Brands, p.\n  636. As president he led the Radical Republicans in their effort to\n  eliminate all vestiges of Confederate nationalism and slavery. Upset over\n  uncontrolled violence in the South and wanting to protect African American\n  citizenship, President Grant effectively destroyed the Ku Klux Klan in\n  1871. Grant was the first President to establish Civil Service\n  reform, creating a two-year federally funded Civil Service Commission in\n  1871. Brands, p. 543-44. In terms of foreign\n  policy, Grant revealed an \"unexpected capacity for deliberation and\n  consultation\" that promoted the national interest. Bunting, p. 8. His reputation was marred by his\n  repeated defense of corrupt appointees, and by America's first industrial age\n  economic depression (called the \"Panic of 1873\") that dominated his second\n  term. Brands, p. 521 Although his Republican Party\n  split in 1872 with reformers denouncing him, Grant was easily reelected. By\n  1875 the conservative white Southern opposition regained control of every\n  state in the South and as he left the White House in March 1877 his policies\n  were being undone.\n\nA career soldier, he graduated from the United States Military Academy at West\nPoint and served in the MexicanâAmerican War. When the Civil War began in 1861,\nGrant trained Union volunteer regiments in Illinois. In 1862, as a general he\nfought a series of battles and was promoted to major general after forcing the\nsurrender of a large Confederate army and gaining control of Kentucky and most\nof Tennessee. He then led Union forces to victory after initial setbacks in the\nBattle of Shiloh, earning a reputation as an aggressive commander. In July 1863,\nafter a long, complex campaign, Grant defeated five uncoordinated Confederate\narmies (capturing one of them) and seized Vicksburg. This famous victory gave\nthe Union full control of the Mississippi River, split off the western\nConfederacy, and opened the way for more Union triumphs. After another win at\nthe Battle of Chattanooga in late 1863, President Abraham Lincoln made him\nlieutenant general and commander of all of the Union Armies. As commanding\ngeneral of the army, Grant confronted Robert E. Lee in a series of very bloody\nbattles in 1864 known as the Overland Campaign that ended with the bottling up\nof Lee at Petersburg, outside the Confederate capital of Richmond. During the\nsiege, Grant coordinated a series of devastating campaigns launched by William\nTecumseh Sherman, Philip Sheridan, and George Thomas. Finally breaking through\nLee's trenches, the Union Army captured Richmond in April 1865. Lee surrendered\nhis depleted forces to Grant at Appomattox as the Confederacy collapsed.\nAlthough pro-Confederate historians attacked Grant as a ruthless butcher who won\nby brute force, most historians have hailed his military genius. Bonekemper\n(2004), pp. 271â82.\n\nGrant's two consecutive terms as President stabilized the nation after the\nAmerican Civil War and during the turbulent Reconstruction period that\nfollowed. Smith, pp. 13-14. As president, he\nenforced Reconstruction by enforcing civil rights laws and fighting Ku Klux Klan\nviolence. Grant won passage of the Fifteenth Amendment; giving constitutional\nprotection for African-American voting rights. He used the army to build the\nRepublican Party in the South, based on black voters, Northern newcomers\n(\"Carpetbaggers\") and native white supporters (\"Scalawags\"). As a result,\nAfrican Americans were represented in the U.S. Congress for the first time in\nAmerican history in 1870. Reformers praised Grant's Indian peace policy, which\nbroke the deadlock on Indian appropriations in Congress, Smith, p. 524. created the Board of Indian Commissioners\nto make reform recommendations, enlisted Quaker Protestants who controlled mid\nwestern Indian agencies, and curbed Congressional patronage. Smith, pp. 526-27. Grant remained determined to keep Indians from\nbeing exterminated by white settler encroachment or by the U.S. military. Grant's reputation as president by 1875 was at an all-time\nhigh for his previous veto of the Inflation Bill, the passage of the Resumption\nof Specie Act, and Secretary Bristow's successful raids that shut down the\nWhiskey Ring. Smith, p. 585. However, after the Democrats\ngained control of the House in 1875, Grant had to respond to a series of\nCongressional investigations into bribery charges of his Secretary of War\nWilliam W. Belknap and his Secretary of the Navy George M. Robeson.\n\nGrant's foreign policy, led by Secretary of State Hamilton Fish, implemented\nInternational Arbitration, settled the Alabama Claims with Britain and avoided\nwar with Spain over the Virginius Affair. His attempted annexation of the\nDominican Republic failed. Grant's response to the Panic of 1873 gave\nnecessary, although limited, financial relief to New York banking houses, but\nwas ineffective in stopping the severe five-year industrial depression that\nfollowed. More than any other president, Grant had to respond to Congressional\ninvestigations into financial corruption charges of all federal\ndepartments. McFeely-Woodward, p. 134. After leaving\noffice, Grant embarked on a two-year world tour that included many enthusiastic\nroyal receptions. In 1880, he made an unsuccessful bid for a third presidential\nterm. His memoirs were a critical and popular success. Historians until\nrecently have given Grant's presidency the worst rankings; however, his\nreputation has significantly improved because of greater appreciation for his\nforeign policy and civil rights achievements, particularly: avoiding war with\nBritain and Spain, the Fifteenth Amendment, prosecution of the Ku Klux Klan,\nenforcement of voting rights, and his Indian Peace Policy. Northern Republican\ncapitalists who desired reconciliation without concern for civil rights, joined\ntogether with Southern Democrats who forgot the American Civil War was caused\nby slavery, emphasized Grant's presidential scandals, rather than his role in\nbreaking up the Gold Ring and prosecution of the Whiskey Ring.

635-636\n","linknr":2232,"url":"Ulysses_S._Grant","recorded":1376415987,"links":["//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant_(disambiguation)","/wiki/Wikipedia:Protection_policy#semi","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg/20px-Padlock-silver.svg.png","/wiki/File:Ulysses_Grant_1870-1880.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Ulysses_Grant_1870-1880.jpg/220px-Ulysses_Grant_1870-1880.jpg","/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States","/wiki/President_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Schuyler_Colfax","/wiki/Henry_Wilson","/wiki/Andrew_Johnson","/wiki/Rutherford_B._Hayes","/wiki/Commanding_General_of_the_United_States_Army","/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln","/wiki/Andrew_Johnson","/wiki/Henry_Wager_Halleck","/wiki/William_Tecumseh_Sherman","/wiki/Point_Pleasant,_Ohio","/wiki/Ohio","/wiki/Wilton,_New_York","/wiki/New_York","/wiki/Grant%27s_Tomb","/wiki/New_York_City","/wiki/New_York","/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)","/wiki/Julia_Grant","/wiki/Jesse_Root_Grant","/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant,_Jr.","/wiki/Nellie_Grant","/wiki/Frederick_Dent_Grant","/wiki/Alma_mater","/wiki/United_States_Military_Academy","/wiki/Soldier","/wiki/Methodism","/wiki/File:UlyssesSGrantSignature.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/UlyssesSGrantSignature.svg/128px-UlyssesSGrantSignature.svg.png","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)","/wiki/United_States_Army","/wiki/Union_Army","/wiki/File:US_Army_General_insignia_(1866).svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/US_Army_General_insignia_%281866%29.svg/35px-US_Army_General_insignia_%281866%29.svg.png","/wiki/General_of_the_Army_(United_States)","/wiki/21st_Illinois_Volunteer_Infantry_Regiment","/wiki/Army_of_the_Tennessee","/wiki/Military_Division_of_the_Mississippi","/wiki/United_States_Army","/wiki/Mexican-American_War","/wiki/Battle_of_Resaca_de_la_Palma","/wiki/Battle_of_Palo_Alto","/wiki/Battle_of_Monterrey","/wiki/Siege_of_Veracruz","/wiki/Battle_of_Molino_del_Rey","/wiki/Battle_of_Chapultepec","/wiki/American_Civil_War","/wiki/Battle_of_Fort_Donelson","/wiki/Battle_of_Shiloh","/wiki/Siege_of_Vicksburg","/wiki/Chattanooga_Campaign","/wiki/Overland_Campaign","/wiki/Siege_of_Petersburg","/wiki/Appomattox_Campaign","/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States","/wiki/President_of_the_United_States","/wiki/American_Civil_War","/wiki/Union_Army","/wiki/Military_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America","/wiki/Secession_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Robert_E._Lee","#cite_note-Brands.2C_p._636-1","/wiki/Radical_Republicans","/wiki/Southern_United_States","/wiki/African_American","/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-Brands_pp543-544-3","/wiki/Foreign_policy","#cite_note-Bunting_p8-4","/wiki/Industrialisation","/wiki/Panic_of_1873","#cite_note-Brands_p520-5","/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_Republican_Party","/wiki/United_States_Military_Academy","/wiki/Mexican%E2%80%93American_War","/wiki/Kentucky","/wiki/Tennessee","/wiki/Battle_of_Shiloh","/wiki/Vicksburg_Campaign","/wiki/Mississippi_River","/wiki/Chattanooga_Campaign","/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln","/wiki/Robert_E._Lee","/wiki/Overland_Campaign","/wiki/Siege_of_Petersburg","/wiki/William_Tecumseh_Sherman","/wiki/Philip_Sheridan","/wiki/George_Henry_Thomas","#cite_note-6","/wiki/American_Civil_War","/wiki/Reconstruction_Era_of_the_United_States","#cite_note-Smith_pp13-14-7","/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan","/wiki/Fifteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","/wiki/African-American","/wiki/Carpetbaggers","/wiki/Scalawags","/wiki/African_Americans","#cite_note-Smith_p524-8","/wiki/Board_of_Indian_Commissioners","/wiki/Quaker","/wiki/Protestants","#cite_note-Smith_pp526-527-9","#cite_note-Smith_p524-8","/wiki/Whiskey_Ring","#cite_note-Sp585-10","/wiki/William_W._Belknap","/wiki/George_M._Robeson","/wiki/Hamilton_Fish","/wiki/International_Arbitration","/wiki/Alabama_Claims","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Spain","/wiki/Virginius_Affair","/wiki/Dominican_Republic","/wiki/Panic_of_1873","#
