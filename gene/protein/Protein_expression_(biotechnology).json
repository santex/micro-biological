{"cursor":"15032","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Protein expression' is a subcomponent of gene expression. It consists of the\nstages after DNA has been transcribed to messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA is then\ntranslated into polypeptide chains, which are ultimately folded into proteins.\nProtein expression is commonly used by proteomics researchers to denote the\nmeasurement of the presence and abundance of one or more proteins in a\nparticular cell or tissue.\n\nProtein expression systems are very widely used in the life sciences,\nbiotechnology and medicine. Molecular biology research uses numerous proteins\nand enzymes many of which are from expression systems; particularly DNA\npolymerase for PCR, reverse transcriptase for RNA analysis and restriction\nendonucleases for cloning. There are also significant medical applications for\nexpression systems, notably the production of human insulin to treat diabetes.\nProtein expression systems are used to produce certain proteins in biotechnology\nand industry, and more recently to produce sets (combinatorial series) of\nprotein that are screened for drug discovery purpose.\n","linknr":268,"url":"Protein_expression_(biotechnology)","recorded":1362484488,"links":12,"instances":["biology","genetics","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Gene expression"],"headings":["Expression systems","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/EscherichiaColi_NIAID.jpg/220px-EscherichiaColi_NIAID.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["translation","biology"],["host","biology"],["transformation","genetics"]],"members":["translation","transformation","host"],"related":["Gene_expression","Translation_(biology)","Polypeptide","Proteins","Proteomics","Biotechnology","Medicine","Molecular_biology","DNA_polymerase","Reverse_transcriptase","Restriction_endonuclease","Insulin","Diabetes","Bacteria","Yeast","Baculovirus","Insect","Mammalian","Host_(biology)","Bacteria","Yeast","Cell_lines","Virus","Baculovirus","Retrovirus","Adenovirus","Plasmid","Bacterial_artificial_chromosome","Bacteriophage","Lambda_phage","Posttranslational_modification","Insect","Mammal","X-ray_crystallography","Nuclear_magnetic_resonance","Subcloning","Plasmid","Transformation_(genetics)","IPTG","Lactose","Glutamate","Lysine","Epidermal_growth_factor","Secretory_pathway","Twin-arginine_translocation_pathway","Lipopolysaccharides","Endotoxins","Transfection","Sf9","Sf21","Army_worm","High_Five_cells","Cabbage_looper","Schneider_2_cells","Drosophila_melanogaster","Gene_expression"]}
