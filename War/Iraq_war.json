UK forces ended\ncombat operations on 30 April 2009. Iraqi\nPrime Minister Nouri al‑Maliki said he supported the accelerated pullout\nof U.S. forces. In a speech at the Oval Office on Obama declared \"the\nAmerican combat mission in Iraq has ended. Operation Iraqi Freedom is over, and\nthe Iraqi people now have lead responsibility for the security of their\ncountry.\"  Beginning 1 September 2010, the\nAmerican operational name for its involvement in Iraq changed from \"Operation\nIraqi Freedom\" to \"Operation New Dawn\". The remaining 50,000 U.S. troops were\ndesignated as \"advise and assist brigades\" assigned to non-combat operations\nwhile retaining the ability to revert to combat operations as necessary. Two\ncombat aviation brigades also remain in Iraq. In September 2010, the\nAssociated Press issued an internal memo reminding its reporters that \"combat in\nIraq is not over\", and \"U.S. troops remain involved in combat operations\nalongside Iraqi forces, although U.S. officials say the American combat\nmission has formally ended\".\n\nOn 21 October 2011, President Obama announced that all U.S. troops and\ntrainers would leave Iraq by the end of the year, bringing the U.S. mission\nin Iraq to an end. On 15 December 2011,\nU.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta officially declared the Iraq War over,\nat a flag lowering ceremony in Baghdad.
