He was\nthe author of several influential books and essays, most notably [[Character\nAnalysis]] (1933), [[The Mass Psychology of Fascism]] (1933), and [[Die\nSexualitÃ¤t im Kulturkampf|The Sexual Revolution]] (1936). That he was one of\nthe most radical figures in psychiatry, see [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,907256-\n1,00.html Sheppard 1973].\n*[http://books.google.com/books?id=lq8rwc61ae4C&pg=PA43 Danto 2007], p. 43:\n\"Wilhelm Reich, the second generation psychoanalyst perhaps most often\nassociated with political radicalism ...\" *Turner 2011, p. 114: \"[Reich's\nmobile clinic was] perhaps the most radical, politically engaged psychoanalytic\nenterprise to date.\" *For the publication and significance of The Mass\nPsychology of Fascism and Character Analysis, see\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=ddlMl4jJgh0C&pg=PA163 Sharaf 1994], pp.\n163â164, 168. *For Character Analysis being an important contribution to\npsychoanalytic theory, see:\n:*[http://books.google.com/books?id=OcoQTQwTDu8C&pg=PA157&lpg=PA157 Young-Bruehl\n:2008], p. 157: \"Reich, a year and a half younger than Anna Freud, was the\n:youngest instructor at the Training Institute, where his classes on\n:psychoanalytic technique, later presented in a book called Character Analysis,\n:were crucial to his whole group of contemporaries.\"\n:*[http://books.google.com/books?id=uaFaiUZsFD4C&pg=PA35 Sterba 1982], p. 35:\n:\"This book [Character Analysis] serves even today as an excellent introduction\n:to psychoanalytic technique.

His work on character contributed to the development of Anna Freud's\nThe Ego and the Mechanisms of Defence (1936), and his idea of muscular armour â\nthe expression of the personality in the way the body moves â shaped innovations\nsuch as body psychotherapy, Fritz Perls's Gestalt therapy, Alexander Lowen's\nbioenergetic analysis, and Arthur Janov's primal therapy. His writing influenced\ngenerations of intellectuals: during the 1968 student uprisings in Paris and\nBerlin, students scrawled his name on walls and threw copies of The Mass\nPsychology of Fascism at the police. For Anna Freud, see\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=jtO7czidPeYC&pg=PA14 Bugental, Schneider and\nPierson 2001], p. 14: \"Anna Freud's work on the ego and the mechanisms of\ndefense developed from Reich's early research (A.

Described by Elizabeth Danto as a large man with a cantankerous style\nwho managed to look scruffy and elegant at the same time, he tried to reconcile\npsychoanalysis with Marxism, arguing that neurosis is rooted in physical, sexual\nand socio-economic conditions, and in particular in a lack of what he called\n\"orgastic potency.\" He visited patients in their homes to see how they lived,\nand took to the streets in a mobile clinic, promoting adolescent sexuality and\nthe availability of contraceptives, abortion and divorce, a provocative message\nin Catholic Austria. He said he wanted to \"attack the neurosis by its prevention\nrather than treatment.\" For Danto's description of Reich, see\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=lq8rwc61ae4C&pg=PA118 Danto 2007], p. 118.\n*That he visited patients in their homes, see\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=EUw9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA278 Grossinger 1982], p.\n278, and Turner 2011, p. 82. *For the issues he promoted, see Turner 2011, p.\n114, and [http://books.google.com/books?id=ddlMl4jJgh0C&pg=PA4 Sharaf 1994], pp.\n4â5, 347, 481â482. *For orgastic potency and neurosis, see Corrington 2003, p.\n75; and [http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/23/books/review/adventures-in-the-\norgasmatron.html?pagewanted=all Turner, 23 September 2011]. *That he said he\nwanted to \"attack the neurosis by its prevention rather than treatment,\" see\nTurner 2011, p. 114.\n\nFrom the 1930s onwards he became an increasingly controversial figure; from 1932\nuntil four years after his death no publisher other than his own published his\nwork. His promotion of sexual permissiveness disturbed the psychoanalytic\ncommunity and his associates on the political left, and his vegetotherapy, in\nwhich he massaged his disrobed patients to dissolve their muscular armour,\nviolated the key taboos of psychoanalysis. For no publisher other than his\nown publishing his work from 1932, see\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=ddlMl4jJgh0C&pg=PA169 Sharaf 1994], p. 169;\nfor violating psychoanalytic taboos, pp. 234â235. *For his sexual permissiveness\ndisturbing certain groups, see\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=lq8rwc61ae4C&pg=PA120 Danto 2007], p.\n120. He moved to New York in 1939, in part to escape the Nazis, and\nshortly after arriving there coined the term \"orgone\" â derived from \"orgasm\"\nand \"organism\" â for a cosmic energy he said he had discovered, which he said\nothers referred to as God or ether. In 1940 he started building orgone\naccumulators, devices that his patients sat inside to harness the reputed health\nbenefits, leading to newspaper stories about sex boxes that cured\ncancer. [http://books.google.com/books?id=ddlMl4jJgh0C&pg=PA301 Sharaf\n1994], pp. 301â306. *That Reich said God was the spiritual aspect of orgone and\nthe ether the physical, see\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=ddlMl4jJgh0C&pg=PA472 Sharaf 1994], p. 472;\nand Reich, Ether, God and Devil, pp. 39ff, 50.\n\nFollowing two critical articles about him in The New Republic and Harper's, the\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration obtained an injunction against the interstate\nshipment of orgone accumulators and associated literature, believing they were\ndealing with a \"fraud of the first magnitude.\" For the articles, see\n[http://www.harpers.org/archive/1947/04/0032908 Brady, April 1947]; and\n[http://www.webcitation.org/68E1awEUD Brady, 26 May 1947]. *For \"fraud of the\nfirst magnitude,\" see [http://books.google.com/books?id=ddlMl4jJgh0C&pg=PA364\nSharaf 1994], p. 364. Charged with contempt in 1956 for having violated\nthe injunction, Reich was sentenced to two years in prison, and in June and\nAugust that year over six tons of his publications were burned by order of the\ncourt, one of the most notable examples of censorship in the history of the\nUnited States.
