(See Geography section.)]]\n\nThe 'Southern United States'âcommonly referred to as the 'American South',\n'[[Dixie]]', or simply 'the South'âis an area in the southeastern and south-\ncentral United States. The region is known for its culture and history, having\ndeveloped its own customs, musical styles and varied cuisines that have helped\ndistinguish it in some ways from the rest of the United States. The Southern\nethnic heritage is diverse and includes strong European (mostly English, Scotch,\nand Irish) African, and some Native American components. Several\nSouthern states (Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia) were\nEnglish Colonies that sent delegates to sign the Declaration of Independence and\nthen fought against the English along with the Northern Colonists during the\nRevolutionary War. The basis for much Southern culture derives from the pride in\nthese states being among the 13 original colonies (and much of the population of\nthe South had fore-fathers who emigrated west from these colonies). Manners and\ncustoms reflect the early population of the South's relationship with England as\nwell as that of Africa and to some extent the native populations. {{cite\nweb|author= Bethune, Lawrence E |title= Scots to Colonial North Carolina efore\n1775 |work= Lawrence E. Bethune's M.U.S.I.C.s Project\n|url=http://www.dalhousielodge.org/Thesis/scotstonc.htm }}\n\nSome other aspects of the historical and cultural development of the South have\nbeen influenced byâaccording to some scholars of Southern historyâan early\nsupport for the doctrine of States' Rights, the institution of slave labor on\nplantations in the Lower South; the presence of a large proportion of African\nAmericans in the population; and the legacy of the Civil War and Reconstruction\nEra, as seen in thousands of lynchings (mostly from 1880 to 1930), the\nsegregated system of separate schools and public facilities known as \"Jim Crow\",\nthat lasted until the 1960s, and the widespread use of poll taxes and other\nmethods to frequently deny blacks of the right to vote or hold office until the\n1960s. In more modern times, however, the South has become the most integrated\nregion of the country and race-relations on par with those elsewhere. Since the\nlate 1960s blacks have held and currently hold many high offices, such as mayor\nand police chief, in many cities such as Atlanta and New Orleans. Gallup\nPoll: U.S. race relations by region; The South. November 19, 2002|http://www.gallup.com/poll/7234/US-Race-Relations-Region-\nSouth.aspx The first African American elected mayor of a\npredominantly white southern city was Howard Nathaniel Lee of Chapel Hill, North\nCarolina, in 1968. The last three majors of Savannah,\nGeorgia have been black. It's current major is a black woman, Edna Jackson, who\nwas elected in 2012.\n\nHistorically, the South relied heavily on agriculture, and was highly rural\nuntil after 1945. It has since become more industrialized and urban and has\nattracted national and international migrants. The American South is now among\nthe fastest-growing areas in the United States. While there has been rapid\neconomic growth, every Southern state with the exceptions of Delaware, Maryland,\nVirginia, and Florida has a higher poverty rate than the American\naverage. Poverty is especially prevalent in rural areas. Sociological\nresearch indicates that Southern collective identity stems from political,\ndemographic, and cultural distinctiveness. The region contains the Bible Belt,\nan area of high church attendance, especially Evangelical churches such as the\nSouthern Baptist Convention. Studies have shown that Southerners are more\nconservative than non-Southerners in several areas, including religion,\nmorality, international relations and race relations. This is evident in both the\nregion's religious attendance figures and in the support for the Republican\nParty in political elections since the 1960s.\n\nOverall, the South has had lower percentages of high school graduates, lower\nhousing values, lower household incomes, and lower cost of living than the rest\nof the United States. These factors, combined with the fact that\nSoutherners have continued to maintain strong loyalty to family ties, has led\nsome sociologists to label white Southerners a \"quasi-ethnic regional\ngroup\". In previous censuses, the largest ancestry group identified\nby Southerners was English or mostly English, [http://www.census.gov/population/www/censusdata/files/pc80-\ns1-10/tab03.pdf Ancestry of the Population by State: 1980 â Table 3 ][http://www.census.gov/population/www/censusdata/files/pc80-\ns1-10/tab03a.pdf Table 3a. Persons Who Reported a Single Ancestry Group for\nRegions, Divisions and States: 1980] [http://www.census.gov/population/www/censusdata/files/pc80-\ns1-10/tab01.pdf Table 1.Type of Ancestry Response for Regions, Divisions and\nStates: 1980] with 19,618,370 self-reporting \"English\" as an ancestry on\nthe 1980 census, followed by 12,709,872 listing \"Irish\" and 11,054,127 \"Afro-\nAmerican\". Almost a third of all Americans who claim English ancestry\ncan be found in the American South, and over a quarter of all Southerners claim\nEnglish descent as well. Wilson, Charles Reagan. Ferris, William R.\nEncyclopedia of Southern culture, page 556 The South also continues to\nhave the highest percentage of African Americans in the country.\n\nApart from its climate, the living experience in the South increasingly\nresembles the rest of the nation. The arrival of millions of Northerners\n(especially in major metropolitan areas and coastal areas) Marc Egnal,\nDivergent paths: how culture and institutions have shaped North American growth\n(1996) p 170 and millions of Hispanics Rebecca Mark and Robert C.\nVaughan, The South (2004) p. 147 means the introduction of cultural values\nand social norms not rooted in Southern traditions. Cooper and Knotts,\n\"Declining Dixie: Regional Identification in the Modern American South\", p.\n1084 Christopher A. Cooper and H. Gibbs Knotts, eds. The New Politics\nof North Carolina (2008) Observers conclude that collective identity and\nSouthern distinctiveness are thus declining, particularly when defined against\n\"an earlier South that was somehow more authentic, real, more unified and\ndistinct\". Edward L. Ayers, What Caused the Civil War? Reflections on the\nSouth and Southern History (2005) p. 46 The process has worked both ways,\nhowever, with aspects of Southern culture spreading throughout a greater portion\nof the rest of the United States in a process termed \"Southernization\".
