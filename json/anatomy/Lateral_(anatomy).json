{"cursor":"65490","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nStandard '[[anatomical]] terms of location' are designations employed in\nscience that deal with the anatomy of animals to avoid ambiguities that might\notherwise arise. They are not language-specific, and thus require no\ntranslation. They are universal terms that may be readily understood by\nzoologists who speak any language.\n\nWhile these terms are standardized within specific fields of biology, they can\ndiffer dramatically from one discipline to another. Differences in terminology\nremain a problem that, to some extent, still separates the fields of zoological\nanatomy (sometimes called zootomy) and human (medical) anatomy (sometimes called\nandrotomy).\n\nThe Craniata (vertebrates) share a substantial heritage of common structure,\nallowing much of the same terminology to be used for all of them. It is\nnecessary for this terminology to be based on the anatomy of the animal in a\nstandard way to avoid ambiguities such as might occur if a word such as \"top\"\nwere used, which might designate the head of a human but the left or right side\nof a flounder. Most animals, furthermore, are capable of moving relative to\ntheir environment. So while \"up\" might refer to the direction of a standing\nhuman's head, the same term (\"up\") might be used to refer to the direction of\nthe belly of a supine human. It is also necessary to employ some specific\nanatomical knowledge in order to apply the terminology unambiguously: For\nexample, while the ears would be superior to (above) the shoulders in a human,\nthis fails when describing the armadillo, where the shoulders are above the\nears. Thus, in veterinary terminology, the ears would be cranial to (i.e.,\n\"toward the head from\") the shoulders in the armadillo, the dog, the kangaroo,\nor any other vertebrate, including the human. Likewise, while the belly is\nconsidered anterior to (in front of) the back in humans, this terminology fails\nfor the flounder, the armadillo, and the dog. In veterinary terms, the belly\nwould be ventral (\"toward the abdomen\") in all vertebrates. In human anatomy, as\nwill be explained below, all naming is based on positions relative to the body\nin a standing (standard anatomical) position with arms at the side and palms\nfacing forward (thumbs out). While the universal vertebrate terminology used in\nveterinary medicine would work in human medicine, the human terms are thought to\nbe too well established to change.\n\nFor invertebrates, locational terminology becomes more complicated, as many\nspecies are not bilaterally symmetrical. In these species, terminology depends\non the type of symmetry present (if any).\n\nThus, standardized anatomical (and zootomical) terms of location have been\ndeveloped, usually based on Latin words, to enable all biological and medical\nscientists to precisely delineate and communicate information about animal\n(including human) bodies and their component organs.\n","linknr":591,"url":"Lateral_(anatomy)","recorded":1362579796,"links":52,"instances":["biology","fish","anatomy","bone","zoology","bone","biology","anatomy","zoology","anatomy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Anatomy|*","Animal
