If this modification ends in mineral compounds\nlike CO 2, NH 4+ , or H 2O, the\nbiotransformation is called '[[Mineralization (biology)|mineralisation]]'.\n\nBiotransformation means chemical alteration of chemicals such as (but not\nlimited to) nutrients, amino acids, toxins, and drugs in the body. It is also\nneeded to render nonpolar compounds polar so that they are not reabsorbed in\nrenal tubules and are excreted. Biotransformation of xenobiotics can dominate\ntoxicokinetics and the metabolites may reach higher concentrations in organisms\nthan their parent compounds.
