{"cursor":"5986","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" (Balistoides viridescens) creates feeding opportunities for smaller fish by\n moving large rocks too big for them to shift themselves.]] In ecology,\n 'commensalism' is a class of relationship between two organisms where one\n organism benefits without affecting the other. It compares with mutualism, in\n which both organisms benefit, and parasitism, when one benefits while the other\n is harmed.\n\nCommensalism derives from the English word [[wikt:commensal|commensal]], meaning\n\"sharing of food\" in human social interaction, which in turn derives from the\nLatin cum mensa, meaning \"sharing a table\". Originally, the term was used to\ndescribe the use of waste food by second animals, like the carcass eaters that\nfollow hunting animals, but wait until they have finished their meal.\n","linknr":472,"url":"Metabiosis","recorded":1362509273,"links":59,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biological interactions","Symbiosis"],"headings":["Examples of commensurable relationships","Arguments","Types","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Titan_Triggerfish.jpg/220px-Titan_Triggerfish.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Fly_June_2008-2.jpg/220px-Fly_June_2008-2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/FoodWeb.jpg/140px-FoodWeb.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg/140px-Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mutualism","biology"],["mutualism","biology"],["mutualism","biology"],["mutualism","biology"]],"members":["mutualism"],"related":["Ecology","Mutualism_(biology)","Parasitism","English_language","Latin","Cattle_Egret","Cattle","Horse","Bird","Army_ant","Forest_floor","Orchid","Moss","Gut_flora","Mutualism_(biology)","Mutualism_(biology)","Parasitism","Epiphytes","Eureka,_California","Symbiosis","Arthropod","Mite","Insect","Beetle","Fly","Bee","Pseudoscorpion","Mammal","Millipede","Bird","Epiphyte","Plant","Orchid","Maggots","Hermit_crab","Gastropod","Symbiosis","Mutualism_(biology)","Parasitism","Remora","Cleaner_fish"]}
