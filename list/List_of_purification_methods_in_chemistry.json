{"cursor":"5066","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Purification in a chemical context is the physical separation of a chemical\nsubstance of interest from foreign or contaminating substances. The following\nlist of chemical purification methods should not be considered exhaustive.\n\n*Affinity purification is used to purify proteins by retaining them on a column\nthrough their affinity to antibodies, enzymes or receptors which have been\nimmobilised on the column.\n\n*Filtration is a mechanical method to separate solids from liquids or gases by\npassing the feed stream through a porous sheet such as a cloth or membrane,\nwhich retains the solids and allows the liquid to pass through.\n\n*Centrifugation is a process in which light particles are revolved over high\nspeed with the help of electric motor so that the fine particles which do not\nsettle at bottom would settle down.\n\n*Evaporation is used to remove volatile liquids from non-volatile solutes which\ncannot be done through filtration due to the small size of the substances.\n\n*Solvent extraction removes an impurity, or recovers a desired product, by\ndissolving it in a solvent in which other components of the feed material\nare soluble.\n\n*Crystallization separates a product from a liquid feedstream, often in\nextremely pure form, by cooling the feedstream or adding precipitants which\nlower the solubility of the desired product so that it forms crystals. The pure\nsolid crystals are then separated from the remaining liquor by filtration or\ncentrifugation.\n\n*Recrystallization: In analytical and synthetic chemistry work, purchased\nreagents of doubtful purity may be recrystallized, e.g. dissolved in a very pure\nsolvent, and then crystallized, and the crystals recovered, in order to improve\nand/or verify their purity.\n\n*Adsorption removes a soluble impurity from a feedstream by trapping it on the\nsurface of a solid material such as activated carbon which forms strong\nnoncovalent chemical bonds with the impurity. Chromatography employs adsorption\nand desorption on a packed bed of a solid to purify multiple components of a\nsingle feedstream.\n\n*Smelting is used to produce metals from raw ore, and involves adding chemicals\nto the ore and heating it up to the melting point of the metal.\n\n*Refining is used primarily in the petroleum industry, whereby crude oil is\nheated and separated into stages according to the condensation points of the\nvarious elements.\n\n*Distillation, widely used in petroleum refining and in purification of ethanol\nseparates volatile liquids on the basis of their relative volatilities.\n\n*Water purification combines a number of methods to produce potable or\ndrinking water.\n\n*Downstream processing refers to purification of chemicals, pharmaceuticals and\nfood ingredients produced by fermentation or synthesized by plant and animal\ntissues, for example antibiotics, citric acid, vitamin E, and insulin.\n\n*Fractionation refers to a purification strategy in which some relatively\ninefficient purification method is repeatedly applied to isolate the desired\nsubstance in progressively greater purity.\n\n*Electrolysis refers to the breakdown of substances using an electric current.\nThis removes impurities in a substance that an electric current is run through\n\n*Sublimation is the process of changing of any substance (usually on\nheating) from a solid to a gas (or from gas to a solid) without passing\nthrough liquid phase.\n\n*Bioleaching is the extraction of metals from their ores through the use of\nliving organisms.\n\nUSING A SEPARATING FUNNEL\n\nImmiscible liquids,such as oil and water can be separated by using a separating\nfunnel. The mixture is put into a separating funnel, shaken and allowed to\nsettle. The oil and water from two separate layer. The liquid with higher\ndensity, in this case water forms the lower layer. Remove the stopper and open\nthe tap after standing. The water runs out through the tap. The oil remains in\nthe funnel and can be run out into another beaker.\n\nSOLVENT EXTRACTION\n\nA useful technique for dissolving out a component from a mixture using a\nsuitable solvent is called SOLVENT EXTRACTION.\n\nAssume we wish to extract iodine which is dissolved in water together with some\nimpurities. Iodine is more soluble than water. We can put the aqueous solution\nof iodine into a separating funnel and add 1,1,1-trichloroethane to it. Water\nand 1,1,1-trichloroethane form two separate layers because they are immiscible.\nAfter shaking, most of the iodine will then dissolve in the 1,1,1-\ntrichloroethane layer. 1,1,1-trichloroethane from water, pure iodine can then be\nobtained by evaporating after separating.\n","linknr":124,"url":"List_of_purification_methods_in_chemistry","recorded":1376419876,"links":["/w/index.php?title=List_of_purification_methods_in_chemistry&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=List_of_purification_methods_in_chemistry&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_purification_methods_in_chemistry","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Contamination","/wiki/Affinity_purification","/wiki/Antibody","/wiki/Enzyme","/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)","/wiki/Filtration","/wiki/Solid","/wiki/Liquid","/wiki/Gas","/wiki/Centrifugation","/wiki/Evaporation","/wiki/Soluble","/wiki/Solvent_extraction","/wiki/Solvent","/wiki/Solubility","/wiki/Crystallization","/wiki/Solubility","/wiki/Crystal","/wiki/Recrystallization_(chemistry)","/wiki/Adsorption","/wiki/Activated_carbon","/wiki/Noncovalent","/wiki/Chromatography","/wiki/Smelting","/wiki/Metal","/wiki/Ore","/wiki/Chemical","/wiki/Heating","/wiki/Refining","/wiki/Petroleum","/wiki/Distillation","/wiki/Ethanol","/wiki/Water_purification","/wiki/Drinking_water","/wiki/Downstream_processing","/wiki/Industrial_fermentation","/wiki/Antibiotics","/wiki/Citric_acid","/wiki/Vitamin_E","/wiki/Insulin","/wiki/Fractionation","/wiki/Electrolysis","/wiki/Sublimation_(chemistry)","/wiki/Bioleaching","/w/index.php?title=List_of_purification_methods_in_chemistry&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=List_of_purification_methods_in_chemistry&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/Separation_process","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_purification_methods_in_chemistry&oldid=565454078","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Laboratory_techniques","/wiki/Category:Chemistry-related_lists","/wiki/Category:Chemical_processes","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=List+of+purification+methods+in+chemistry&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=List+of+purification+methods+in+chemistry","/wiki/List_of_purification_methods_in_chemistry","/wiki/Talk:List_of_purification_methods_in_chemistry","#","/wiki/List_of_purification_methods_in_chemistry","/w/index.php?title=List_of_purification_methods_in_chemistry&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=List_of_purification_methods_in_chemistry&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=List_of_purification_methods_in_chemistry&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/List_of_purification_methods_in_chemistry","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/List_of_purification_methods_in_chemistry","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=List_of_purification_methods_in_chemistry&oldid=565454078","/w/index.php?title=List_of_purification_methods_in_chemistry&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3130283","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=List_of_purification_methods_in_chemistry&id=565454078","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=List+of+purification+methods+in+chemistry","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=List+of+purification+methods+in+chemistry&oldid=565454078&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=List_of_purification_methods_in_chemistry&printable=yes","//ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D9%85%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%82:%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%85%D8%A9_%D8%B7%D8%B1%D9%82_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%86%D9%82%D9%8A%D8%A9_%D9%81%D9%8A_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%A1","//et.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ainete_puhastamine","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purification_(chimie)","//si.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%B6
