Horses and donkeys are different species, with different\nnumbers of chromosomes. Of the two F1 hybrids between these two species, a mule\nis easier to obtain than a hinny (the offspring of a male horse and a female\ndonkey). The size of a mule and work to which it is put depends largely on the\nbreeding of the mule's dam. Mules can be lightweight, medium weight, or even,\nwhen produced from draught horse mares, of moderately heavy weight. pp. 85–87.\n\nIt has been claimed that mules are \"more patient, sure-footed, hardy and long-\nlived than horses, and they are considered less obstinate, faster, and more\nintelligent than donkeys.\" Jackson, Louise A.

ISBN 0-87842-499-7\n\nA female mule that has estrus cycles and thus, in theory, could carry a fetus,\nis called a \"molly\" or \"Molly mule,\" though the term is sometimes used to refer\nto female mules in general. Pregnancy is rare, but can occasionally occur\nnaturally as well as through embryo transfer. One of several terms for a gelded\nmule is a \"John mule.\"\n","linknr":-1,"url":"mule","recorded":1376418419,"links":[],"instances":["horse","horse","animal","horse","horse","horse","horse","horse","horse","horse"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Livestock","Equid hybrids","Livestock guardians"],"headings":["Biology","Characteristics","Fertility","Modern mules","Mule clone","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["mane","horse"],["rump","animal"],["sorrel","horse"],["bay","horse"],["black","horse"],["gray","horse"],["white","horse"],["roan","horse"],["buckskin","horse"],["colt","horse"],["sierra_nevada","u.s."],["war_in_afghanistan","2001-present"]],"members":["war_in_afghanistan","bay","buckskin","rump","mane","colt","sorrel","white","roan","black","sierra_nevada","gray"],"related":["Animal","Chordate","Mammalia","Perissodactyla","Equidae","Donkey","Horse","Donkey","Mare","Chromosome","F1_hybrid","Hinny","Mare","Mare","Estrus","Embryo_transfer","Rhyton","Brygos","Aleria","Mane_(horse)","Donkey","Rump_(animal)","American_quarter_horse","Pony","Sorrel_(horse)","Bay_(horse)","Black_(horse)","Gray_(horse)","White_(horse)","Roan_(horse)","Palomino","Dun_gene","Buckskin_(horse)","Pinto_horse","Tobiano","Working_animal","Clay","Heterosis","Appaloosa","Leopard_complex","Food_and_Agriculture_Organization_of_the_United_Nations","China","Mexico","Central_America","South_America","Chromosome","BBC_News","Herodotus","Second_Persian_invasion_of_Greece","Cytogenetics_and_Genome_Research","Morocco","National_Public_Radio","Seattle_Post_Intelligencer","Colt_(horse)","Journal_of_Heredity","Fez,_Morocco","Morocco","Tractors","Truck","American_Mammoth_Jack","United_States","George_Washington","Catalan_donkey","Western_riding","English_pleasure","Dressage","Show_jumping","Wilderness","Sierra_Nevada_(U.S.)","Pack_station","Sierra_Club","Amish","Soviet_war_in_Afghanistan","Mujahideen","Milton_Bearden","War_in_Afghanistan_(2001-present)","United_States_Marine_Corps","Mountain_Warfare_Training_Center","Bridgeport,_California","University_of_Idaho","Utah_State_University","Cloning","Project_Idaho","University_of_Idaho","Animal_science","Veterinary_medicine","Idaho_Gem","University_of_Idaho","40_acres_and_a_mule","African_Wild_Ass","Horse","Hinny","Jennet","Kiang","Onager","Headless_Mule"]}
