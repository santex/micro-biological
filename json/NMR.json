This energy is at\na specific resonance frequency which depends on the strength of the magnetic\nfield and the magnetic properties of the isotope of the atoms; in practical\napplications, the frequency is similar to VHF and UHF television broadcasts\n(60â1000 MHz). NMR allows the observation of specific quantum mechanical\nmagnetic properties of the atomic nucleus. Many scientific techniques exploit\nNMR phenomena to study molecular physics, crystals, and non-crystalline\nmaterials through NMR spectroscopy. NMR is also routinely used in advanced\nmedical imaging techniques, such as in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n\nAll isotopes that contain an odd number of protons and/or of neutrons (see\nIsotope) have an intrinsic magnetic moment and angular momentum, in other words\na nonzero spin, while all nuclides with even numbers of both have a total spin\nof zero. The most commonly studied nuclei are and , although nuclei from\nisotopes of many other elements (e.g. , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ) have been\nstudied by high-field NMR spectroscopy as well.\n\nA key feature of NMR is that the resonance frequency of a particular substance\nis directly proportional to the strength of the applied magnetic field. It is\nthis feature that is exploited in imaging techniques; if a sample is placed in a\nnon-uniform magnetic field then the resonance frequencies of the sample's nuclei\ndepend on where in the field they are located. Since the resolution of the\nimaging technique depends on the magnitude of magnetic field gradient, many\nefforts are made to develop increased field strength, often using\nsuperconductors. The effectiveness of NMR can also be improved using\nhyperpolarization, and/or using two-dimensional, three-dimensional and higher-\ndimensional multi-frequency techniques.\n\nThe principle of NMR usually involves two sequential steps: *The alignment\n(polarization) of the magnetic nuclear spins in an applied, constant magnetic\nfield 'H' 0. *The perturbation of this alignment of the nuclear spins\nby employing an electro-magnetic, usually radio frequency (RF) pulse. The\nrequired perturbing frequency is dependent upon the static magnetic field\n('H' 0) and the nuclei of observation.\n\nThe two fields are usually chosen to be perpendicular to each other as this\nmaximizes the NMR signal strength. The resulting response by the total\nmagnetization ('M') of the nuclear spins is the phenomenon that is exploited in\nNMR spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging. Both use intense applied\nmagnetic fields ('H' 0) in order to achieve dispersion and very high\nstability to deliver spectral resolution, the details of which are described by\nchemical shifts, the Zeeman effect, and Knight shifts (in metals).\n\nNMR phenomena are also utilized in low-field NMR, NMR spectroscopy and MRI in\nthe Earth's magnetic field (referred to as Earth's field NMR), and in several\ntypes of magnetometers.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"NMR","recorded":1376418430,"links":[],"instances":["mathematics","physics","physics","atomic_structure","nmr","magnetism"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Nuclear magnetic
