{"cursor":"35958","size":14,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" complex showing several cofactors, including flavin, iron-sulfur centers,\n and heme.]]\n\nA 'cofactor' is a non-protein chemical compound that is bound to a protein and\nis required for the protein's biological activity. These proteins are commonly\nenzymes, and cofactors can be considered \"helper molecules\" that assist in\nbiochemical transformations.\n\nCofactors can be classified depending on how tightly they bind to an enzyme,\nwith loosely-bound cofactors termed 'coenzymes' and tightly-bound cofactors\ntermed 'prosthetic groups'. Some sources also limit the use of the term\n\"cofactor\" to inorganic substances. An inactive enzyme,\nwithout the cofactor is called an apoenzyme, while the complete enzyme with\ncofactor is the holoenzyme.\n\nSome enzymes or enzyme complexes require several cofactors. For example, the\nmultienzyme complex pyruvate dehydrogenase at the junction of\nglycolysis and the citric acid cycle requires five organic cofactors and one\nmetal ion: loosely bound thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), covalently bound\nlipoamide and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and the cosubstrates\nnicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD +) and coenzyme A (CoA), and a\nmetal ion (Mg 2+ ).\n\nOrganic cofactors are often vitamins or are made from vitamins. Many contain the\nnucleotide adenosine monophosphate (AMP) as part of their structures, such as\nATP, coenzyme A, FAD, and NAD +. This common structure may reflect a\ncommon evolutionary origin as part of ribozymes in an ancient RNA world. It has\nbeen suggested that the AMP part of the molecule can be considered a kind of\n\"handle\" by which the enzyme can \"grasp\" the coenzyme to switch it between\ndifferent catalytic centers.\n","linknr":1017,"url":"Cofactor_(biochemistry)","recorded":1362510949,"links":58,"instances":["biochemistry","genetics","molecular","biochemistry","unit"],"pdf":["http://mic.sgmjournals.org/cgi/reprint/145/8/1817.pdf","http://mic.sgmjournals.org/cgi/reprint/145/8/1817.pdf","http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1929/euler-chelpin-lecture.pdf","http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1929/euler-chelpin-lecture.pdf"],"categories":["Enzymes","Cofactors|"],"headings":["Classification","Inorganic","Organic","Non-enzymatic
