Instead, players develop characters based on certain\n | rules and are responsible for deciding what those characters do over the\n | course of the game. isbn = 978-0-7864-4451-9}} Actions taken within\n | many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and\n | guidelines. (Tychsen 2006:76) \"The variety of role playing games makes it\n | inherently challenging to provide a common definition. However, all forms of\n | role playing games â be they PnP RPGs, CRPGs, MMORPGs or LARPS - share a\n | group of characteristics, which makes them identifiable from other types of\n | games: storytelling with rules, control of fictional characters, a fictitious\n | reality, usually the presence of a game master (or game engine), and at least\n | one player.\"\n\nThere are several forms of RPG. The original form, sometimes called the\n[[tabletop role-playing game|tabletop RPG]], is conducted through discussion,\nwhereas in live action role-playing games (LARP) players physically perform\ntheir characters' actions. (Tychsen et\nal. 2006:255) \"LARPs can be viewed as forming a distinct category of RPG because\nof two unique features: (a) The players physically embody their characters, and\n(b) the game takes place in a physical frame. Embodiment means that the physical\nactions of the player are regarded as those of the character. Whereas in a RPG\nplayed by a group sitting around a table, players describe the actions of their\ncharacters (e.g., âI run to stand beside my friendâ)\" In both of these\nforms, an arranger called a game master (GM) usually decides on the rules and\nsetting to be used and acts as referee, while each of the other players plays\nthe role of a single character. {{cite web\n| url = http://www.darkshire.net/~jhkim/rpg/whatis/tabletop.html title =\n| \"Narrative\" or \"Tabletop\" RPGs accessdate = 2008-09-09 last = Kim first = John\n}}\n\nSeveral varieties of RPG also exist in electronic media, such as multi-player\ntext-based MUDs and their graphics-based successors, massively multiplayer\nonline role-playing games (MMORPGs). Role-playing games also include single-\nplayer offline role-playing video games in which players control a character or\nteam who undertake quests, and may include capabilities that advance using\nstatistical mechanics. These games often share settings and rules with tabletop\nRPGs, but emphasize character advancement more than collaborative\nstorytelling. (Tychsen 2006:75)\n\"PnP RPGs are an example of interactive narratives. The rules and fictional\nworlds that form the basis for these games function as a vessel for\ncollaborative, interactive storytelling. This is possibly the most important\nfeature of PnP RPGs, and one that CRPGs have yet to reproduce.\" {{cite book\n  | last = Crawford first = Chris authorlink = coauthors = title = Chris\n  | Crawford on Game Design publisher = New Riders Publishing year = 2003\n  | location = pages = 163 url = doi = id = quote = In some ways, the emphasis\n  | on character development has impeded progress in storytelling with RPGs. The\n  | central premise of these [computer RPGs] is that the player steadily builds\n  | his abilities by acquiring wealth, tools, weapons, and experience. This\n  | emphasis on character development tends to work against the needs of\n  | dramatic development - dramatic twists and turns clash with the prevailing\n  | tone of steady development. Fortunately, this impediment is not fundamental\n  | to the RPG genre; it is a cultural expectation rather than an architectural\n  | necessity. isbn = 978-0-13-146099-7}}\n\nDespite this variety of forms, some game forms such as trading card games and\nwargames that are related to role-playing games may not be included. Role-\nplaying activity may sometimes be present in such games, but it is not the\nprimary focus. (HeliÃ¶ 2004) \"In the family of role-playing games there are\nalso a whole bunch of other game types and game-like activities that can be\nincluded or excluded, like the collectible card games (such as Magic: The\nGathering) and board and strategy games (like Warhammer 40.000), or different\nforms of theatrical and larp-like combinations, such as fate-play. The action of\nrole-playing is usually somehow present in these game forms, but the focus can\nbe more either in the competitive nature of the game (MtG, Warhammer), or in the\nimmersive performance (as in fate-play), than in role-playing itself.\" The\nterm is also sometimes used to describe roleplay simulation games and exercises\nused in teaching, training, and academic research.\n","linknr":414,"url":"role-playing_game","recorded":1376416552,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Role-playing_game&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Role-playing_game&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Role-playing","/wiki/File:Dados_4_a_20_caras_trans.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Dados_4_a_20_caras_trans.png/220px-Dados_4_a_20_caras_trans.png","/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game","/wiki/Live_action_role-playing_game","/wiki/Role-playing_video_game","/wiki/Forum_RPG","/wiki/Campaign_setting","/wiki/List_of_campaign_settings","/wiki/Character_creation","/wiki/Gamemaster","/wiki/History_of_role-playing_games","/wiki/Japanese_role-playing_game","/wiki/Role-playing_game_system","/wiki/Role-playing_game_terms","/wiki/Player_character","/wiki/Non-player_character","/wiki/Role-playing_game_theory","/wiki/GNS_Theory","/w/index.php?title=The_Big_Model&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Threefold_Model","/wiki/Statistic_(role-playing_games)","/wiki/List_of_campaign_settings","/wiki/List_of_Japanese_role-playing_games_by_genre","/wiki/List_of_live_action_role-playing_groups","/wiki/List_of_role-playing_game_artists","/wiki/List_of_role-playing_game_designers","/wiki/List_of_game_manufacturers","/wiki/List_of_role-playing_games_by_name","/wiki/List_of_role-playing_games_by_genre","/wiki/Timeline_of_pen_and_paper_role-playing_games","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/10_sided_die.svg/27px-10_sided_die.svg.png","/wiki/Portal:Role-playing_games","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Symbol_information_vote.svg/16px-Symbol_information_vote.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Role-playing_games","/wiki/Template:RPG","/wiki/Template_talk:RPG","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:RPG&action=edit","/wiki/Role-playing","#cite_note-secondperson-1","#cite_note-gurpsrp-2","/wiki/Game","/wiki/Role","/wiki/Player_character","/wiki/Setting_(literature)","/wiki/Acting","#cite_note-Cover-3","/wiki/Role-playing_game_system","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game","/wiki/Live_action_role-playing_game","#cite_note-TychsenEtAl2006DefiningLARP-5","/wiki/Game_master","#cite_note-whatisnarrative-6","/wiki/Online_text-based_role-playing_game","/wiki/MUD","/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game","/wiki/Offline","/wiki/Role-playing_video_game","#cite_note-Tychsen2006CollaborativeNarrative-7","#cite_note-Crawford-8","/wiki/Trading_card_game","/wiki/Wargaming","#cite_note-9","/wiki/Roleplay_simulation","#Purpose","#Varieties","#Tabletop","#Live_action","#Electronic_media","#Single-player","#Multi-player","#Gamemaster","#See_also","#Notes","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Role-playing_game&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Role-playing_game_theory","/wiki/Storytelling","#cite_note-gurpsrp-2","#cite_note-10","#cite_note-11","#cite_note-12","#cite_note-13","/wiki/Storytelling_game","/wiki/Make_believe","/wiki/Plot_(narrative)","/wiki/Campaign_setting","/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief","/wiki/Realism_(arts)","/wiki/Narrativist","/wiki/Gamist","/wiki/Simulationist","/w/index.php?title=Role-playing_game&action=edit&section=2","#cite_note-Tychsen2007-14","/wiki/Role-playing_game_system","/wiki/Campaign_setting","/wiki/Storytelling_game","/wiki/Gaming_convention","/w/index.php?title=Role-playing_game&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/File:RPG-2009-Berlin-2.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/RPG-2009-Berlin-2.jpg/220px-RPG-2009-Berlin-2.jpg","/wiki/File:RPG-2009-Berlin-2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Gamemaster%27s_screen","/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game","#cite_note-15","#cite_note-16","/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons","/wiki/Fantasy_literature","/wiki/Wargaming","#cite_note-17","#cite_note-Barton-18","/wiki/Retronym","#cite_note-whatisnarrative-6","/w/index.php?title=Role-playing_game&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Live_action_role-playing_game","/wiki/File:LARP_Sternenfeuer_Treffen.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/LARP_Sternenfeuer_Treffen.JPG/220px-LARP_Sternenfeuer_Treffen.JPG","/wiki/File:LARP_Sternenfeuer_Treffen.JPG","//
