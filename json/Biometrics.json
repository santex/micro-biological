It is also used to identify individuals in groups that are\nunder surveillance.\n\nBiometric identifiers are the distinctive, measurable characteristics used to\nlabel and describe individuals.

'Behavioral' biometrics are related to the behavior of a person,\nincluding but not limited to: typing rhythm, gait, and voice. Strictly speaking, voice is also a physiological trait because\nevery person has a different vocal tract, but voice recognition is mainly based\non the study of the way a person speaks, commonly classified as behavioral.\nBiometric voice recognition is separate and distinct from speech recognition\nwith the latter being concerned with accurate understanding of speech content\nrather than identification or recognition of the person speaking. Some\nresearchers have coined the term 'behaviometrics' to describe the latter class\nof biometrics.\n\nMore traditional means of access control include token-based identification\nsystems, such as a driver's license or passport, and knowledge-based\nidentification systems, such as a password or personal identification\nnumber. Since biometric identifiers are unique to\nindividuals, they are more reliable in verifying identity than token and knowledge-\nbased methods; however, the collection of biometric identifiers raises privacy\nconcerns about the ultimate use of this information.
