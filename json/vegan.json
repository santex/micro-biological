It can also refer to the practice of abstaining from the use of\nanimal products generally, not just in diet, including such things as glue\nderived from animal parts, shoe leather, and natural hair wigs. The term\nsometimes includes an associated philosophy rejecting the commodity status of\nhigher-order or sentient animals. A follower of veganism is known as a 'vegan'.\n\nDistinctions are sometimes made between different categories of veganism.\n'Dietary vegans' (or strict vegetarians) refrain from consuming animal products,\nnot only meat but, in contrast to ovo-lacto vegetarians, also eggs, dairy\nproducts and other animal-derived substances. The term 'ethical vegan' is often\napplied to those who not only follow a vegan diet, but extend the vegan\nphilosophy into other areas of their lives, and oppose the use of animals or\nanimal products for any purpose. For the ethical/dietary\ndistinction, see for example:\n*[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/01/05/health/main7216497.shtml \"Vegan\nDiets Become More Popular, More Mainstream\"], Associated Press/CBS News, 5\nJanuary 2011: \"Ethical vegans have a moral aversion to harming animals for human\nconsumption ... though the term often is used to describe people who follow the\ndiet, not the larger philosophy.\" *Francione, Gary and Garner, Robert. The\nAnimal Rights Debate: Abolition Or Regulation? Columbia University Press, 2010\n(hereafter Francione and Garner 2010), [http://books.google.com/books?id=BwK-\nZrHeapoC&pg=PA62 p. 62]: \"Although veganism may represent a matter of diet or\nlifestyle for some, ethical veganism is a profound moral and political\ncommitment to abolition on the individual level and extends not only to matters\nof food but also to the wearing or using of animal products. Ethical veganism is\nthe personal rejection of the commodity status of nonhuman animals ...\"\n*[http://books.google.com/books?id=aQgAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA50 \"Veganism\"],\n[[Vegetarian Times]], January 1989: \"Webster's dictionary provides a most dry\nand limiting definition of the word 'vegan': 'one that consumes no animal food\nor dairy products.' This description explains dietary veganism, but so-called\nethical vegans â and they are the majority â carry the philosophy\nfurther.\" Another term used is environmental veganism, which refers to the\nrejection of animal products on the premise that the harvesting or industrial\nfarming of animals is environmentally damaging and unsustainable. Cole, Matthew. \"Veganism,\" in Margaret Puskar-Pasewicz.\nCultural Encyclopedia of Vegetarianism.

In 1951 the society extended the definition of veganism\nto mean \"the doctrine that man should live without exploiting animals,\" and in\n1960 H. Jay Dinshah started the American Vegan Society, linking veganism to the\nJain concept of ahimsa, the avoidance of violence against living beings.

Oxford University Press, 2007,\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=AoWlCmNDA3QC&pg=PA604 pp. 604â605].\n* For the origins of the term \"vegan,\" see\n  [http://www.vegparadise.com/24carrot610.html \"Interview with Donald Watson\"],\n  Vegetarians in Paradise, 11 August 2004: \"I invited my early readers to\n  suggest a more concise word to replace \"non-dairy vegetarian.\" Some bizarre\n  suggestions were made like \"dairyban, vitan, benevore, sanivore, beaumangeur\",\n  et cetera. I settled for my own word, \"vegan\", containing the first three and\n  last two letters of \"vegetarian\" â \"the beginning and end of vegetarian.\" The\n  word was accepted by the Oxford English Dictionary and no one has tried to\n  improve it.\" *Watson, Donald. [http://ukveggie.com/vegan_news/vegan_news_1.pdf\n  Vegan News], No. 1, November 1944: \"We should all consider carefully what our\n  Group, and our magazine, and ourselves, shall be called. 'Non-dairy' has\n  become established as a generally understood colloquialism, but like 'non-\n  lacto' it is too negative. Moreover, it does not imply that we are opposed to\n  the use of eggs as food.\"\n* For the Vegan Society extending its definition of \"veganism\" in 1951, see\n  Cross, Leslie. [http://www.ivu.org/history/world-forum/1951vegan.html\n  \"Veganism Defined\"], The Vegetarian World Forum, 5(1), Spring 1951.\n\nVeganism is a small but growing movement. In many countries the number of vegan\nrestaurants is increasing, and some of the top athletes in certain endurance\nsports â for instance, the Ironman triathlon and the ultramarathon â practise\nveganism, including raw veganism. Berry 2007,\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=AoWlCmNDA3QC&pg=PA604 pp. 604â605]:\n* \"Despite the seeming hardships a vegan diet imposes on its practitioners,\n  veganism is a burgeoning movement, especially among younger Americans. In the\n  endurance sports, such as the Ironman triathlon and the Utramarathon, the top\n  competitors are vegans who consume much of their vegan food in its uncooked\n  state. Even young weight lifters and body builders are gravitating to a vegan\n  diet, giving the lie to the notion that eating animal flesh is essential for\n  strength and stamina. Brendan Brazier, a young athlete who regularly places in\n  the top three in international triathlon events and who formulated Vega, a\n  line of plant-based performance products, said of his fellow vegan athletes:\n  'We're beginning to build a strong presence in every sport.'\" *For more about\n  its popularity, see\n  [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/01/05/health/main7216497.shtml \"Vegan\n  Diets Become More Popular, More Mainstream\"], Associated Press, 5 January\n  2011. *Also see Nijjar, Raman.
