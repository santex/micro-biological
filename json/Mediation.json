{"cursor":"59599","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\n'Mediation', as used in law, is a form of alternative dispute resolution (ADR),\na way of resolving disputes between two or more parties with concrete effects.\nTypically, a third party, the mediator, assists the parties to negotiate a\nsettlement. Disputants may mediate disputes in a variety of domains, such as\ncommercial, legal, diplomatic, workplace, community and family matters.\n\nThe term \"mediation\" broadly refers to any instance in which a third party helps\nothers reach agreement. More specifically, mediation has a structure, timetable\nand dynamics that \"ordinary\" negotiation lacks. The process is private and\nconfidential, possibly enforced by law. Participation is typically voluntary.\nThe mediator acts as a neutral third party and facilitates rather than directs\nthe process.\n\nMediators use various techniques to open, or improve, dialogue between\ndisputants, aiming to help the parties reach an agreement. Much depends on the\nmediator's skill and training. As the practice gained popularity, training\nprograms, certifications and licensing followed, producing trained, professional\nmediators committed to the discipline.\n\nThe benefits of mediation http://www.eternalalliances.com/mediation/benefits-of-\nmediation include:\n\n* Cost—While a mediator may charge a fee comparable to that of an\n  attorney, the mediation process generally takes much less time than moving a\n  case through standard legal channels. While a case in the hands of a lawyer or\n  a court may take months or years to resolve, mediation usually achieves a\n  resolution in a matter of hours. Taking less time means expending less money\n  on hourly fees and costs.\n\n* Confidentiality—While court hearings are public, mediation remains\n  strictly confidential. No one but the parties to the dispute and the\n  mediator(s) know what happened. Confidentiality in mediation has such\n  importance that in most cases the legal system cannot force a mediator to\n  testify in court as to the content or progress of mediation. Many mediators\n  destroy their notes taken during a mediation once that mediation has finished.\n  The only exceptions to such strict confidentiality usually involve child abuse\n  or actual or threatened criminal acts.\n\n* Control—Mediation increases the control the parties have over the\n  resolution. In a court case, the parties obtain a resolution, but control\n  resides with the judge or jury. Often, a judge or jury cannot legally provide\n  solutions that emerge in mediation. Thus, mediation is more likely to produce\n  a result that is mutually agreeable for the parties.\n\n* Compliance—Because the result is attained by the parties working\n  together and is mutually agreeable, compliance with the mediated agreement is\n  usually high. This further reduces costs, because the parties do not have to\n  employ an attorney to force compliance with the agreement. The mediated\n  agreement is, however, fully enforceable in a court of law.\n\n* Mutuality—Parties to a mediation are typically ready to work mutually\n  toward a resolution. In most circumstances the mere fact that parties are\n  willing to mediate means that they are ready to \"move\" their position. The\n  parties thus are more amenable to understanding the other party's side and\n  work on underlying issues to the dispute. This has the added benefit of often\n  preserving the relationship the parties had before the dispute.\n\n* Support—Mediators are trained in working with difficult situations. The\n  mediator acts as a neutral facilitator and guides the parties through the\n  process. The mediator helps the parties think \"outside of the box\" for\n  possible solutions to the dispute, broadening the range of possible\n  solutions.

process.\n","linknr":719,"url":"Mediation","recorded":1376416829,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Mediation&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Mediation&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Wikipedia:Mediation","/wiki/Meditation","/wiki/Mediation_(disambiguation)","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mediation&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Alternative_dispute_resolution","/wiki/Arbitration","/wiki/Conciliation","/wiki/Negotiation","/wiki/Collaborative_law","/wiki/Conflict_resolution","/wiki/Dispute_resolution","/wiki/Lawyer_supported_mediation","/wiki/Party-directed_mediation","/wiki/Restorative_justice","/wiki/Template:Alternative_Dispute_Resolution","/wiki/Template_talk:Alternative_Dispute_Resolution","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Alternative_Dispute_Resolution&action=edit","/wiki/Alternative_dispute_resolution","/wiki/Negotiation","/wiki/Dialogue","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","#History","#Uses","#South_Africa","#Industrial_relations","#Australia","#Workplace_matters","#Community_mediation","#Peer_Mediation","#Commercial_disputes","#Native-title_mediation","#Global_relevance","#Process","#Roles","#Mediator","#Parties","#Preparation","#Disclosure","#Participation","#Preparation_2","#Meeting","#Post-mediation_activities","#Ratification_and_review","#Referrals","#Mediator_debriefing","#Measuring_effectiveness","#Mediators","#Education_and_training","#Australia_2","#Codes_of_conduct","#Australia_3","#France","#Accreditation","#Australia_4","#Selection","#Criteria","#Third_party_nomination","#Liability","#Tapoohi_v_Lewenberg_.28Australia.29","#United_States","#Variants","#Evaluative_mediation","#Facilitative_mediation","#Transformative_mediation","#Mediation_with_arbitration","#Online","#Alternatives","#Conciliation","#Counselling","#Early_neutral_evaluation","#Arbitration","#Litigation","#Shuttle_diplomacy","#Philosophy","#Conflict_prevention","#Confidentiality","#Without-prejudice_privilege","#Legal_implications","#Principles","#Ethics","#Conflict_management","#See_also","#Notes","#References","#Preparing_for_Mediation_in_Australia","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Mediation&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Mediation&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/Phoenicia","/wiki/Commerce","/wiki/Ancient_Greece","/wiki/Rome","/wiki/Civilization","/wiki/Roman_law","/wiki/Justinian_I","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wise_man","/wiki/Tribal_chief","#cite_note-cfrmediation1-3","/wiki/Confucianism","/wiki/Buddhism","#cite_note-cfrmediation1-3","/w/index.php?title=Mediation&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Mediation&veaction=edit&section=2","/wiki/File:Agent_de_m%C3%A9diation_urbaine_%C3%A0_Fort-de-France_(Martinique).jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Agent_de_m%C3%A9diation_urbaine_%C3%A0_Fort-de-France_%28Martinique%29.jpg/220px-Agent_de_m%C3%A9diation_urbaine_%C3%A0_Fort-de-France_%28Martinique%29.jpg","/wiki/File:Agent_de_m%C3%A9diation_urbaine_%C3%A0_Fort-de-France_(Martinique).jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Fort-de-France","/wiki/Martinique","/wiki/Prenuptial","/wiki/Divorce#Mediated_divorce","/wiki/Alimony","/wiki/Eldercare","/wiki/Business","/wiki/Medical_ethics","/wiki/Wrongful_termination","/wiki/Discrimination","/wiki/Harassment","/wiki/Grievance","/wiki/Labor_dispute","/wiki/Contract","/wiki/Medical_malpractice","/wiki/Personal_injury","/wiki/Partnership","/wiki/Restorative_Justice","/wiki/Non-profit","/w/index.php?title=Mediation&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Mediation&veaction=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=National_Peace_Accord&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Mediation&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=Mediation&veaction=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=Mediation&action=edit&s
