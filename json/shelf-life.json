Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd\ned. It applies to foods, beverages, pharmaceutical drugs, chemicals, and\nmany other perishable items. In some regions, an advisory best before, mandatory\nuse by, or freshness date is required on packaged perishable foods.\n\nShelf life is the recommended maximum time for which products can be stored,\nduring which the defined quality of a specified proportion of the goods remains\nacceptable under expected (or specified) conditions of distribution, storage and\ndisplay.\n\nMost expiry dates are used as guidelines based on normal and expected handling\nand exposure to temperature. Use prior to the expiration date does not guarantee\nthe safety of a food or drug, and a product is not necessarily dangerous or\nineffective after the expiration date.\n\nFor food, shelf life is different from expiration date: the former refers to\nfood quality, the latter to food safety. See  A product that has\npassed its shelf life might still be safe, but quality is no longer guaranteed.\nIn most food stores, waste is minimized by using stock rotation, which involves\nmoving products with the earliest sell by date from the warehouse to the sales\narea, and then to the front of the shelf, so that most shoppers will pick them\nup first and thus they are likely to be sold before the end of their shelf life.\nThis is important, as consumers enjoy fresher goods, and furthermore some stores\ncan be fined for selling out of date products; most if not all would have to\nmark such products down as wasted, resulting in a financial loss.\n\nShelf life is most influenced by several factors: exposure to light and heat,\ntransmission of gases (including humidity), mechanical stresses, and\ncontamination by things such as micro-organisms. Product quality is often\nmathematically modelled around a parameter (concentration of a chemical\ncompound, a microbiological index, or moisture content).\n\nFor some foods, health issues are important in determining shelf life. Bacterial\ncontaminants are ubiquitous, and foods left unused too long will often be\ncontaminated by substantial amounts of bacterial colonies and become dangerous\nto eat, leading to food poisoning. However, shelf life alone is not an accurate\nindicator of how long the food can safely be stored. For example, pasteurized\nmilk can remain fresh for five days after its sell-by date if it is refrigerated\nproperly. In contrast, if milk already has harmful bacteria, the use-by dates\nbecome irrelevant.\n\nThe expiration date of pharmaceuticals specifies the date the manufacturer\nguarantees the full potency and safety of a drug. Most medications continue to\nbe effective and safe for a time after the expiration date. A rare exception is\na case of renal tubular acidosis purportedly caused by expired\ntetracycline. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1395800/\n\"Recycling Expensive Medication: Why Not?\"] by Jay Pomerantz, Medscape General\nMedicine, April 26, 2004. A study conducted by the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration covered over 100 drugs, prescription and over-the-counter. The\nstudy showed that about 90% of them were safe and effective as long as 15 years\npast their expiration dates. Joel Davis, a former FDA expiration-date compliance\nchief, said that with a handful of exceptions - notably nitroglycerin, insulin\nand some liquid antibiotics - most expired drugs are probably\neffective. {{Cite news\n  | last=Cohen first=Laurie P. title=Many Medicines Prove Potent for Years Past\n  | Their Expiration Dates. newspaper=Wall Street Journal volume=235 issue=62\n  | pages=A1 (cover story) date=2000-03-28}}\n\nShelf life is not significantly studied during drug development, and drug\nmanufacturers have economic and liability incentives to specify shorter shelf\nlives so that consumers are encouraged to discard and repurchase products. One\nmajor exception is the Shelf Life Extension Program (SLEP) of the U.S.\nDepartment of Defense (DoD), which commissioned a major study of drug efficacy\nfrom the FDA starting in the mid-1980s. One criticism is that the U.S. Food and\nDrug Administration (FDA) refused to issue guidelines based on SLEP research for\nnormal marketing of pharmaceuticals even though the FDA performed the study. The\nSLEP and FDA signed a memorandum that scientific data could not be shared with\nthe public, public health departments, other government agencies, and drug\nmanufacturers. http://www.usamma.army.mil/dod_slep.cfm State and local\nprograms are not permitted to participate. http://www.upmc-\nbiosecurity.org/website/resources/publications/2009/2009-03-27-\nmax_st_local_med_cntr.html The failure to share data has caused foreign\ngovernments to refuse donations of expired medications. http://www.essentia-\nldrugs.org/edrug/archive/200003/msg00076.php One exception occurred during\nthe 2010 Swine Flu Epidemic when the FDA authorized expired Tamiflu based on\nSLEP\nData. http://www.fda.gov/newsevents/publichealthfocus/ucm154962.htm\nThe SLEP discovered that drugs such as cipro remained effective nine years after\ntheir shelf life, and, as a cost-saving measure, the US military routinely uses\na wide range of SLEP tested products past their official shelf life if drugs\nhave been stored\nproperly. http://www.usamma.army.mil/assets/docs/dlar.pdf\n\nPreservatives and antioxidants may be incorporated into some food and drug\nproducts to extend their shelf life. Some companies use induction sealing and\nvacuum/oxygen-barrier pouches to assist in the extension of the shelf life of\ntheir products where oxygen causes the loss.\n\nThe DoD Shelf-Life Program defines shelf-life as,  The total period\nof time beginning with the date of manufacture, date of cure (for elastomeric\nand rubber products only), date of assembly, or date of pack (subsistence only),\nand terminated by the date by which an item must be used (expiration date) or\nsubjected to inspection, test, restoration, or disposal action; or after\ninspection/laboratory test/restorative action that an item may remain in the\ncombined wholesale (including manufacture's) and retail storage systems and\nstill be suitable for issue or use by the end user. Shelf-life is not to be\nconfused with service-life (defined as, A general term used to quantify the\naverage or standard life expectancy of an item or equipment while in use. When a\nshelf-life item is unpacked and introduced to mission requirements, installed\ninto intended application, or merely left in storage, placed in pre-expended\nbins, or held as bench stock, shelf-life management stops and service life\nbegins.) \n\nShelf life is often specified in conjunction with a specific product, package,\nand distribution system. For example, an MRE field ration is designed to have a\nshelf life of three years at 80Â°F and six months at 100Â°F. {{Cite journal\n  | last= first=US Natick Labs title=Nanotechnology applied to
