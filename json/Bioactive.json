When a drug is a\ncomplex chemical mixture, this activity is exerted by the substance's active\ningredient or pharmacophore but can be modified by the other constituents.\nActivity is generally dosage-dependent. Further, it is common to have effects\nranging from beneficial to adverse for one substance when going from low to high\ndoses. Activity depends critically on fulfillment of the ADME criteria.\n\nWhereas a material is considered bioactive if it has interaction with or effect\non any cell tissue in the human body, pharmacological activity is usually taken\nto describe beneficial effects, i.e. the effects of drug candidates as well as a\nsubstance's toxicity.\n\nIn the study of biomineralisation, bioactivity is often meant as the formation\nof calcium phosphate deposits on the surface of objects placed in simulated body\nfluid, a buffer solution with ion content similar to blood.\n","linknr":131,"url":"Bioactive","recorded":1362506214,"links":25,"instances":["biochemistry","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Pharmacodynamics"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/FlattenedRoundPills.jpg/40px-FlattenedRoundPills.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["dose","biochemistry"],["cell","biology"]],"members":["dose","cell"],"related":["Pharmacology","Drug","Organism","Active_ingredient","Pharmacophore","Dose_(biochemistry)","ADME","Cell_(biology)","Human_body","Drug_candidate","Toxicity","Biomineralisation","Calcium_phosphate","Simulated_body_fluid","Buffer_solution","Blood","Lipinski's_Rule_of_Five","QSAR","Chemical_property","Molecular_property","Physical_property","Chemical_structure"]}
