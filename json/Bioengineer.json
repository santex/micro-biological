{"cursor":"11884","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"{{Multiple issues|\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n'Biological engineering', 'biotechnological engineering' or 'bioengineering'\n(including '[[biological systems engineering]]') is the application of concepts\nand methods of biology (and secondarily of physics, chemistry, mathematics, and\ncomputer science) to solve real-world problems related to the life sciences\nand/or the application thereof, using engineering's own analytical and\nmethodologies and also its traditional sensitivity to the cost and practicality\nof the solution(s) arrived at. In this context, while traditional engineering\napplies physical and mathematical sciences to analyze, design and manufacture\ninanimate tools, structures and processes, biological engineering uses primarily\nthe rapidly developing body of knowledge known as molecular biology to study and\nadvance applications of living organisms.\n\nThe differentiation between biological engineering and biomedical engineering\ncan be unclear, as many universities now use the terms \"bioengineering\" and\n\"biomedical engineering\" interchangeably. NIH working definition of bioengineering\nhttp://www.becon.nih.gov/bioengineering_definition.htm accessed, 1/1/2007\nBiomedical engineers are specifically focused on applying biological and other\nsciences toward medical innovations, whereas biological engineers are focused\nprincipally on applying biology - but not necessarily to medical uses. Neither\nbiological engineering nor biomedical engineering is wholly contained within the\nother, as there are non-biological products for medical needs and biological\nproducts for non-medical needs.\n\nAn especially important application is the analysis and cost-effective\nsolution of problems related to human health, but the field is much more\ngeneral than that. For example, biomimetics is a branch of biological\nengineering which strives to find ways in which the structures and functions\nof living organisms can be used as models for the design and engineering of\nmaterials and machines. Systems biology, on the other hand, seeks to utilize\nthe engineer's familiarity with complex artificial systems, and perhaps the\nconcepts used in \"reverse engineering\", to facilitate the difficult process of\nrecognition of the structure, function, and precise method of operation of\ncomplex biological systems.\n","linknr":534,"url":"Bioengineer","recorded":1362503936,"links":40,"instances":["engineering"],"pdf":["http://www.abet.org/Linked%20Documents-UPDATE/Criteria%20and%20PP/A004%2010-11%20Accredition%20Policy%20and%20Procedure%20Manual%2011-05-09.pdf","http://www.vanth.org/curriculum/def_bme_curr.pdf"],"categories":["Biological engineering|","Health sciences"],"headings":["History","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b7/Spread_of_Disease.JPG/220px-Spread_of_Disease.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/16px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["process","engineering"]],"members":["process"],"related":["Physics","Chemistry","Mathematics","Computer_science","Life_sciences","Engineering","Analysis","Methodology","Design","Manufacture","Structure","Process_(engineering)","Molecular_biology","Living_organisms","Biomedical_engineering","Human_health","Biomimetics","Systems_biology","Biotechnology","Molecular_biology","Biochemistry","Microbiology","Pharmacology","Protein","Cell_biology","Immunology","Neurobiology","Neuroscience","Heinz_Wolff","Vegetation","Civil_engineering","Construction","Mississippi_State_University","MIT","Utah_State_University","Bioinformatics","Thermodynamics","Biotechnology","Life","Prosthetics","Mechanical_engineering","Agricultural_engineering","Biotechnology","Bioprocess_design","Biocatalysis","Bioseparation","Bioinformatics","Bioenergy","Synthetic_biology","Horizontal_gene_transfer","Cell_engineering","Tissue_engineering","Metabolic_engineering","Biomedical_technology","Biomedical_diagnostics","Biomedical_therapy","Biomechanics","Biomaterials","AIChE"]}
