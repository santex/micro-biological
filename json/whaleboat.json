Morgan at Mystic Seaport]]\n\nA 'whaleboat' is a type of open boat that is relatively narrow and pointed at\nboth ends, enabling it to move either forwards or backwards equally well. It was\noriginally developed for whaling, and later became popular for work along\nbeaches, since it does not need to be turned around for beaching or refloating.\n\nWhaleboats were also extensively used in warfare. Colonel Benjamin Church is\ncredited with first pioneering their use for amphibious combat operations\nagainst Abenaki and Mi'kmaq tribes in what is today Maine and Acadia . His\ntroops, New England colonial forces and Native allies from southern New England,\nused them as early as 1696 (during King William's War). Others in the\nNortheastern borderlands followed suit and they were utilized throughout the\nimperial conflicts of the early 18th century, and extensively used by both\nBritish and colonial troops during the French and Indian war. Units that made\nextensive use of whaleboats were the 7th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment at the\nsiege of Louisburg in 1745, often referred to as \"the whaleboat regiment,\" and\nGorham's Rangers, formed in 1744, initially a company of Indians mainly from\nCape Cod, many of whom were employed as whalers, and which later evolved into a\nBritish Army ranger company in the 1750s and 1760s.

In 1772, American\ncolonials used whaleboats to attack and destroy in Narragansett Bay. During the\nAmerican Revolutionary War, there were many whaleboat raids, including one with\n230 men led by Return J. Meigs, Sr. to sack Sag Harbor on Long Island in 1777.\nOn December 7, 1782, two fleets of whaleboats fought a bloody battle on Long\nIsland Sound known as the Boats Fight. During the desperate hand-to-hand\nconflict, every man involved was either killed or injured.\n\nWhaleboats are traditionally oar-powered, although in whaling use often had a\ndismountable mast and sails, too. After 1850 most were fitted with a centreboard\nfor sailing. When sailing, steering was with a rudder; when rowing, steering was\ndone with an oar held over the stern. Whaleboats used in whaling had a stout\npost mounted on the aft deck, around which the steersman would cinch the rope\nonce the whale had been harpooned, and by which the whale would drag the boat\nuntil it was killed.\n\nThe term \"whaleboat\" may be used informally of larger whalers, or of a boat used\nfor whale watching. On modern warships, a relatively light and seaworthy boat\nfor transport of ship's crew may be referred to as a whaleboat or whaler. It may\nalso refer to a type of vessel designed as a lifeboat or \"monomoy\" used for\nrecreational and competitive rowing in the San Francisco Bay Area and coastal\nMassachusetts.\n","linknr":132,"url":"whaleboat","recorded":1376416447,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Whaleboat&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Whaleboat&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whaleboat","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Mystic_whaleboat.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Mystic_whaleboat.jpg/220px-Mystic_whaleboat.jpg","/wiki/File:Mystic_whaleboat.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Mystic_Seaport","/wiki/File:MysticWhaleBoat.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/MysticWhaleBoat.JPG/220px-MysticWhaleBoat.JPG","/wiki/File:MysticWhaleBoat.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Whaler","/wiki/Charles_W._Morgan_(ship)","/wiki/Mystic_Seaport","/wiki/Boat","/wiki/Benjamin_Church_(military_officer)","/wiki/Abenaki_people","/wiki/Mi%27kmaq_people","/wiki/Maine","/wiki/Acadia","/wiki/King_William%27s_War","/wiki/French_and_Indian_war","/wiki/Gorham%27s_Rangers","#cite_note-1","/wiki/John_Bradstreet","http://dmna.ny.gov/historic/articles/bateau.htm","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Gasp%C3%A9e_Affair","/wiki/HMS_Gasp%C3%A9e_(1763)","/wiki/Narragansett_Bay","/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War","/wiki/Return_J._Meigs,_Sr.","/wiki/Meigs_Raid","/wiki/Long_Island","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Oar","/wiki/Centreboard","/wiki/Rudder","/wiki/Whaler","/wiki/Whale_watching","/w/index.php?title=Whaleboat&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Whaleboat&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/Whaling","/wiki/Whaler","/w/index.php?title=Whaleboat&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Whaleboat&veaction=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","http://dmna.ny.gov/historic/articles/bateau.htm","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0913372404","/w/index.php?title=Whaleboat&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Whaleboat&veaction=edit&section=3","http://modelshipbuilder.com/page.php?35","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Whaleboat&oldid=563007903","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Boat_types","/wiki/Category:Traditional_boats","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_July_2012","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Whaleboat&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Whaleboat","/wiki/Whaleboat","/wiki/Talk:Whaleboat","#","/wiki/Whaleboat","/w/index.php?title=Whaleboat&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Whaleboat&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Whaleboat&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Whaleboat","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Whaleboat","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Whaleboat&oldid=563007903","/w/index.php?title=Whaleboat&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q286077","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Whaleboat&id=563007903","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Whaleboat","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Whaleboat&oldid=563007903&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Whaleboat&printable=yes","//be.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%92%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%82","//cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velryb%C3%A1%C5%99sk%C3%BD_%C4%8Dlun","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baleini%C3%A8re","//he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%95%D7%99%D7%99%D7%AA%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%AA","//pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welbot","//ru.wikipedia.or
